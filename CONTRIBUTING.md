## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see QUICKSTART.md)
4. Create a new branch for your work

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MobileOrderTracker.git
cd MobileOrderTracker
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Development Setup

Follow the setup instructions in `QUICKSTART.md` to get your development environment ready.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-photo-upload`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/qr-scanning-crash`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-api-guide`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/location-service`)
- `test/` - Test additions/updates (e.g., `test/add-unit-tests`)

### Commit Message Convention

Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(mobile): add incident photo upload

Implemented photo upload functionality for incident reports using
expo-image-picker. Photos are stored in Supabase storage and URLs
are saved in the incidents table.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(dashboard): resolve real-time update race condition

Fixed issue where rapid status updates could cause UI inconsistency.
Added debouncing to real-time subscription handlers.

Fixes #456
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types (avoid `any`)
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types from shared/types.ts

```typescript
// Good
interface Order {
  id: string;
  orderNumber: string;
  status: OrderStatus;
}

// Avoid
const order: any = {...};
```

### React/React Native

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use meaningful component names

```typescript
// Good
const OrderDetailsScreen: React.FC = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  // ...
};

// Avoid
function Screen() {
  var loading = false;
  // ...
}
```

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas
- Use semicolons
- Run linter before committing

```typescript
// Good
const config = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 5000,
};

// Avoid
const config = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  timeout: 5000,
};
```

### File Organization

```
component-name/
  â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.test.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ ComponentName.styles.ts
  â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `OrderDetailsScreen`)
- **Files**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Variables/Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserOrders`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_TIMEOUT`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase (e.g., `OrderStatus`)

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

Write unit tests for:

- Utility functions
- Business logic
- Data transformations
- Edge cases

```typescript
describe("calculateDistance", () => {
  it("should calculate distance between two points", () => {
    const point1 = { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.006 };
    const point2 = { latitude: 40.7589, longitude: -73.9851 };

    const distance = calculateDistance(point1, point2);

    expect(distance).toBeCloseTo(5.6, 1);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

Test integration between:

- API calls and UI
- Database operations
- External services

### E2E Tests

Test critical user flows:

- QR code scanning
- Order creation
- Location tracking
- Status updates

### Running Tests

```bash
# Mobile app
cd mobile-app
npm test

# Dashboard
cd dashboard
npm test

# Watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```
