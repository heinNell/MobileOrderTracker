# 🚀 Quick Fix Summary - Drivers Disappearing

**Issue:** Drivers disappearing from driver list and orders  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**  
**Date:** October 17, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Tenant Filtering** ✅

- **File:** `dashboard/app/drivers/page.tsx`
- **Change:** Added `.eq("tenant_id", userData.tenant_id)` to driver query
- **Why:** Prevents showing drivers from other organizations

### 2. **Inactive Driver Visibility** ✅

- **File:** `dashboard/app/components/EnhancedOrderForm.tsx`
- **Change:** Removed `.eq("is_active", true)` filter, show all drivers with warnings
- **Why:** Prevents "disappearing" when driver deactivated

### 3. **Deactivation Protection** ✅

- **File:** `dashboard/app/drivers/page.tsx`
- **Change:** Added confirmation dialog before deactivating
- **Why:** Prevents accidental deactivation

### 4. **Debug Logging** ✅

- **Files:** Both files
- **Change:** Added console.log statements
- **Why:** Track driver loading and status changes

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test 1: Tenant Filtering

```bash
1. Open dashboard in browser
2. Open DevTools → Console
3. Go to Drivers page
4. Check console for: "Fetching drivers for tenant: [tenant-id]"
5. Verify only your organization's drivers appear
```

### Test 2: Inactive Drivers

```bash
1. Create and assign a driver to order
2. Deactivate the driver (confirm dialog)
3. Edit the order
4. Check driver dropdown shows "⚠️ INACTIVE - [name]"
5. Verify red warning appears if selected
```

### Test 3: Confirmation Dialog

```bash
1. Go to Drivers page
2. Click "Deactivate" on any driver
3. Confirm dialog appears
4. Click Cancel → driver stays active
5. Click Deactivate again → OK → driver deactivated
6. Check console for log entry
```

## 📊 Run Diagnostic Script

### In Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy entire contents of `diagnostic-drivers-disappearing.sql`
4. Run query
5. Check results for:
   - ❌ Inactive drivers
   - ❌ Tenant mismatches
   - ❌ Orphaned orders

## 🚀 Deploy Now

```bash
# Navigate to dashboard
cd dashboard

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test locally first
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Test all scenarios above

# Deploy (choose your platform)
vercel --prod           # If using Vercel
netlify deploy --prod   # If using Netlify
```

---

## 🔍 What to Monitor

### Browser Console (After Deploy)

Look for these logs:

```
✅ "Fetching drivers for tenant: abc-123"
✅ "Loaded 5 drivers for tenant abc-123"
✅ "Driver John Doe deactivated at 2025-10-17..."
```

### Supabase Logs

Check for:

```sql
✅ SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'driver' AND tenant_id = '...'
❌ SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'driver' (missing tenant)
```

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

### Check These:

1. **RLS Policies**

   ```sql
   -- Run in SQL Editor
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';
   ```

   - Look for policies that filter `is_active` or `tenant_id`

2. **Driver Status**

   ```sql
   -- Check if drivers are actually inactive
   SELECT id, full_name, is_active, tenant_id
   FROM users
   WHERE role = 'driver'
   ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Tenant Consistency**
   ```sql
   -- Check for tenant mismatches
   SELECT
     o.order_number,
     o.tenant_id as order_tenant,
     u.full_name,
     u.tenant_id as driver_tenant
   FROM orders o
   JOIN users u ON o.assigned_driver_id = u.id
   WHERE o.tenant_id != u.tenant_id;
   ```
