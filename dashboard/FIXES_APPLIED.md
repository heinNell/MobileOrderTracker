# Mobile Order Tracker Dashboard

This is the centralized dashboard for the Mobile Order Tracker logistics system.

## Fixed Issues

### MIME Type and Resource Loading Issues

The following critical issues have been resolved:

1. **Fixed MIME Type Mismatches**: Updated Next.js configuration to properly serve CSS and JavaScript files with correct MIME types
2. **Added Missing Favicon**: Created proper favicon files (favicon.ico and favicon.svg) to prevent 404 errors
3. **Enhanced Layout Configuration**: Added proper TypeScript metadata and HTML head configuration
4. **Improved Static File Serving**: Added proper headers for static assets to ensure correct content types

### Technical Fixes Applied

- **next.config.js**: Added custom headers to ensure proper MIME types for CSS and JS files
- **app/layout.tsx**: Enhanced with proper TypeScript types and favicon configuration
- **app/favicon.ico**: Added binary favicon file
- **public/favicon.svg**: Added SVG favicon for modern browsers

### Production Build Configuration

The application is now configured for proper production builds with:

- Standalone output mode for optimized deployment
- Proper static asset caching headers
- Correct MIME type handling for all resources
- Improved TypeScript type safety

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter MIME type errors:

1. Clear your browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Stop and restart the development server
3. Check that all static files are being served from the correct paths
4. Verify environment variables are properly configured

The application should now load without MIME type errors or missing resource issues.
