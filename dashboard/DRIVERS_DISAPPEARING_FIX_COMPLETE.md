# ‚úÖ Drivers Disappearing - Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXES APPLIED**

---

## üéØ Problem Summary

**User Report:**
- Drivers appear initially when assigned
- After some time, drivers disappear from the driver list
- Drivers are also removed from orders they were assigned to

**Root Cause Identified:**
1. **Missing Tenant Filter** - Drivers page wasn't filtering by tenant_id
2. **Inactive Driver Hiding** - Order form was completely hiding inactive drivers
3. **No Confirmation** - Drivers could be accidentally deactivated
4. **No Visibility** - No warning when inactive driver selected

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Added Tenant Filter to Drivers Page ‚úÖ

**File:** `dashboard/app/drivers/page.tsx`

**Problem:** 
- Drivers page was loading ALL drivers from ALL tenants
- After RLS policies kicked in or session refreshed, it would filter them out
- Made it look like drivers "disappeared"

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: No tenant filter
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("*")
  .eq("role", "driver")
  .order("full_name");

// AFTER: Filters by current user's tenant
const { data: userData } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("tenant_id")
  .eq("id", session.user.id)
  .maybeSingle();

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("*")
  .eq("role", "driver")
  .eq("tenant_id", userData.tenant_id)  // ‚úÖ Now filters by tenant
  .order("full_name");
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Only shows drivers from current organization
- ‚úÖ Prevents cross-tenant data leaks
- ‚úÖ Consistent with RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Added console logging for debugging

---

### Fix 2: Show Inactive Drivers with Warning ‚úÖ

**File:** `dashboard/app/components/EnhancedOrderForm.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Query used `.eq("is_active", true)` which completely hid inactive drivers
- If driver was deactivated, they disappeared from dropdowns
- Order still had driver assigned, but dropdown showed "Unassigned"

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only active drivers
.eq("is_active", true)

// AFTER: All drivers, sorted by status
.order("is_active", { ascending: false })  // Active first
.order("full_name");
```

**Dropdown Enhancement:**
```typescript
// Shows inactive drivers with red warning
<option 
  key={driver.id} 
  value={driver.id}
  style={{
    color: driver.is_active ? 'inherit' : '#ef4444',
    fontWeight: driver.is_active ? 'normal' : 'bold'
  }}
>
  {!driver.is_active && '‚ö†Ô∏è INACTIVE - '}
  {driver.full_name}
  {driver.phone && ` - ${driver.phone}`}
</option>
```

**Warning Message:**
```typescript
{isInactive && (
  <div className="p-4 bg-red-50 border-red-200">
    <p className="text-sm font-medium text-red-900">
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Inactive Driver Selected
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm text-red-700 mt-1">
      This driver is currently marked as INACTIVE. They will still
      receive the notification, but they may not be available for
      this order. Consider selecting an active driver instead.
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Inactive drivers visible but clearly marked
- ‚úÖ Prevents confusion when driver seems to "disappear"
- ‚úÖ Warning prevents accidental assignment to inactive drivers
- ‚úÖ Historical assignments remain visible

---

### Fix 3: Added Deactivation Confirmation ‚úÖ

**File:** `dashboard/app/drivers/page.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Drivers could be deactivated with single click
- No confirmation dialog
- No warning about consequences
- Easy to do accidentally

**Solution:**
```typescript
const handleToggleDriverStatus = async (
  driverId: string,
  currentStatus: boolean
) => {
  const driver = drivers.find(d => d.id === driverId);
  const driverName = driver?.full_name || "this driver";
  
  // Confirm deactivation
  if (currentStatus) {
    const confirmMsg = 
      `‚ö†Ô∏è Deactivate ${driverName}?\n\n` +
      `This will:\n` +
      `‚Ä¢ Remove them from driver selection lists\n` +
      `‚Ä¢ Hide them from active driver views\n` +
      `‚Ä¢ Keep their order history intact\n\n` +
      `You can reactivate them later if needed.\n\n` +
      `Are you sure?`;
    
    if (!window.confirm(confirmMsg)) {
      return;
    }
  }
  
  // Update with timestamp
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from("users")
    .update({ 
      is_active: !currentStatus,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString()
    })
    .eq("id", driverId);
    
  // Log the action
  console.log(`Driver ${driverName} (${driverId}) ${currentStatus ? 'deactivated' : 'activated'}`);
  
  // Show success message
  alert(`‚úÖ Driver ${currentStatus ? 'deactivated' : 'activated'} successfully`);
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Requires confirmation before deactivating
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of consequences
- ‚úÖ Logs action for audit trail
- ‚úÖ Success/error feedback
- ‚úÖ Updates timestamp for tracking

---

### Fix 4: Enhanced Debug Logging ‚úÖ

**Files:** Both `drivers/page.tsx` and `EnhancedOrderForm.tsx`

**Added Logging:**
```typescript
// When fetching drivers
console.log(`Fetching drivers for tenant: ${userData.tenant_id}`);
console.log(`Loaded ${data?.length || 0} drivers for tenant ${userData.tenant_id}`);

// When toggling status
console.log(`Driver ${driverName} (${driverId}) ${action} at ${new Date().toISOString()}`);

// In EnhancedOrderForm
console.log(`EnhancedOrderForm: Loaded ${drivers?.length || 0} drivers (${active} active, ${inactive} inactive)`);
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Can track when drivers are loaded
- ‚úÖ Can see if tenant filtering works
- ‚úÖ Can identify when drivers are deactivated
- ‚úÖ Helps debug future issues

## üìä Before vs After

### Before Fixes

| Scenario | Behavior | User Experience |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Load drivers page | Shows all tenants | May see wrong drivers |
| Driver deactivated | Disappears completely | "Where did my driver go?" |
| Assign to order | Can't see inactive | Order looks unassigned |
| Deactivate driver | One click, no warning | Easy to do accidentally |
| Debugging | No logs | Can't trace issues |

### After Fixes

| Scenario | Behavior | User Experience |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Load drivers page | Filters by tenant | Only org's drivers |
| Driver deactivated | Shows with warning | Clear inactive status |
| Assign to order | Can see with warning | Can view assignment |
| Deactivate driver | Confirmation required | Intentional action |
| Debugging | Console logs | Can track behavior |

## üîç Monitoring

### What to Watch For

**In Browser Console:**
```
‚úÖ Good logs:
"Fetching drivers for tenant: abc-123"
"Loaded 5 drivers for tenant abc-123"
"Driver John Doe (driver-id-123) deactivated at 2025-10-17T..."

‚ùå Bad logs:
"User has no tenant_id" (user setup issue)
"Error fetching drivers: ..." (database/RLS issue)
```

**In Supabase Logs:**
```
‚úÖ Good queries:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'driver' AND tenant_id = 'abc-123'

‚ùå Bad queries:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'driver' (missing tenant filter)
```
