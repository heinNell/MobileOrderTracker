# Navigation Duplicate Route Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue

Expo Router was detecting duplicate route registrations for "order-details" because multiple files with similar names existed in the `app/(tabs)` directory.

## Root Cause

Expo Router automatically registers all `.js`/`.tsx` files in the `app` directory as routes. We had:

- `[orderId].js` - ✅ The correct dynamic route (active)
- `order-details.js` - ❌ Duplicate static route
- `order-details-enhanced.js` - ❌ Duplicate static route

This caused the warning:

```
Found multiple files with the same name at different extensions: order-details
```

## Solution

Renamed the backup files with underscore prefix (`_`) so Expo Router ignores them:

- `order-details.js` → `_order-details-backup.js`
- `order-details-enhanced.js` → `_order-details-enhanced-backup.js`

**Why underscore?** In Expo Router, files/folders starting with `_` are excluded from routing.

## Current State

### Active Routes

```
app/(tabs)/
├── [orderId].js          ✅ Active dynamic route (with responsive updates)
├── index.js              ✅ Dashboard/Driver Dashboard
├── orders.js             ✅ Orders list
├── scanner.js            ✅ QR Scanner
├── profile.js            ✅ Profile
├── DriverDashboard.js    ✅ Driver Dashboard component
└── LoadActivationScreen.js ✅ Load activation
```

### Backup Files (Preserved)

```
app/(tabs)/
├── _order-details-backup.js          📦 Preserved (ignored by router)
└── _order-details-enhanced-backup.js 📦 Preserved (ignored by router)
```

## Verification

**Before:**

```bash
ls app/(tabs)/ | grep order-details
# order-details.js
# order-details-enhanced.js
# [orderId].js
```

**After:**

```bash
ls app/(tabs)/ | grep -E "(order-details|orderId)"
# [orderId].js                      ✅ Active
# _order-details-backup.js          📦 Backup
# _order-details-enhanced-backup.js 📦 Backup
```

## Navigation Configuration

**`app/(tabs)/_layout.js`:**

```javascript
<Tabs.Screen
  name="[orderId]"
  options={{
    href: null, // Hidden from tab bar (dynamic route)
    title: "Order Details",
  }}
/>
```

This configuration ensures:

- `[orderId]` is registered as a dynamic route
- It's hidden from the tab bar (accessed via navigation)
- No duplicate registrations

## Benefits

✅ No more duplicate route warnings
✅ Backup files preserved for reference
✅ Clean navigation structure
✅ All responsive updates intact in `[orderId].js`

## Testing

After this fix, you should:

1. Restart the Expo dev server
2. Navigate to an order (e.g., tap on order from list)
3. Verify no console warnings about duplicate routes
4. Confirm order details screen works correctly
