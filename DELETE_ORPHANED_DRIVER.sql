-- ================================================================
-- Driver ID: b1f554db-145a-40f6-b572-fb7cae1ae32b
-- Name: Heinrich Nel
-- Phone: +27662731270
-- 
-- This driver was manually inserted into the drivers table but has
-- NO corresponding auth.users entry. Due to FK constraint, we cannot
-- create a users entry without an auth entry.
-- 
-- OPTIONS:
-- 1. DELETE this driver and recreate via dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
-- 2. Keep in drivers table but it won't be visible (NOT RECOMMENDED)
-- ================================================================

-- ================================================================
-- OPTION 1: Delete the orphaned driver (RECOMMENDED)
-- ================================================================
-- This will remove the driver that cannot be fixed
-- You can then recreate it properly via the dashboard
