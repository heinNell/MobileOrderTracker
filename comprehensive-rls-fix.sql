-- üõ†Ô∏è COMPREHENSIVE RLS FIX
-- Fix RLS policies on driver_locations AND map_locations tables

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "driver_locations_select_policy" ON driver_locations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "driver_locations_update_policy" ON driver_locations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "driver_locations_delete_policy" ON driver_locations;

-- Create permissive policies for driver_locations
CREATE POLICY "driver_locations_select_policy" ON driver_locations
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "driver_locations_insert_policy" ON driver_locations
    FOR INSERT TO authenticated 
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "driver_locations_update_policy" ON driver_locations
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated 
    USING (true) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Enable RLS on driver_locations
ALTER TABLE driver_locations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
GRANT ALL ON driver_locations TO authenticated;

-- Now fix map_locations table (if it exists)
