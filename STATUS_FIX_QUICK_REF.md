# 🚀 Quick Fix - Status Transition Error

## The Error You Saw

```
❌ Invalid status transition: {from: 'assigned', to: 'in_progress'}
```

## What I Fixed

**File:** `MyApp/app/(tabs)/[orderId].js`

**Changed this:**

```javascript
assigned: ["activated"],  // ❌ Could only go to activated
```

**To this:**

```javascript
assigned: ["activated", "in_progress"],  // ✅ Can go to either!
```

## Why It Happenedfeedback.js:1 [Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5745543795965952

The mobile app had strict rules requiring drivers to go through every step:

```
assigned → activated → in_progress → in_transit → ...
```

But you wanted to skip the "activated" step and go straight to "in_progress" to start tracking.

## Now You Can

```
✅ assigned → activated → in_progress  (traditional)
✅ assigned → in_progress              (quick start - NEW!)
✅ in_progress → in_transit            (normal)
✅ in_progress → arrived               (skip to arrived - NEW!)
✅ in_transit → loading                (skip ahead - NEW!)
✅ loaded → in_transit                 (go back if needed - NEW!)
```

## Test It

1. Open mobile app (should auto-reload)
2. Go to order with status "assigned"
3. Tap "Start Order" button
4. **Should work now!** ✅

## All Fixed Status Flows

### From "assigned":

- → `activated` (activate first)
- → `in_progress` (start immediately) ✅ **NEW**

### From "in_progress":

- → `in_transit` (start traveling)
- → `arrived` (skip to arrived) ✅ **NEW**

### From "in_transit":

- → `arrived` (reach destination)
- → `loading` (skip to loading) ✅ **NEW**

### From "loaded":

- → `in_transit` (resume travel) ✅ **NEW**
- → `unloading` (start unloading)

## What This Enables

✅ **Quick Start** - Skip activation, go straight to in_progress  
✅ **Skip Steps** - Go directly to arrived if close by  
✅ **Flexibility** - Resume transit from loaded if needed  
✅ **Efficiency** - Fewer button taps for drivers  
✅ **Tracking** - Starts immediately when going to in_progress

## No Rebuild Needed!

If your mobile app is running with `npx expo start --dev-client`, it should auto-reload with the fix!

Just try changing the status again. ✅
