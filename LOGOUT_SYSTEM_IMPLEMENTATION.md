# Centralized Logout System & App Stability Fixes

## Overview

This implementation fixes the logout functionality across the entire mobile application and resolves the constant refreshing issues that were affecting app stability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized Logout Component (`/app/components/LogoutButton.js`)

- **New Component**: Created a reusable `LogoutButton` component with consistent behavior across all screens
- **Multiple Variants**: Supports `primary`, `secondary`, `danger`, and `minimal` styling variants
- **Size Options**: `small`, `medium`, and `large` size configurations
- **Custom Callbacks**: `onLogoutStart` and `onLogoutComplete` hooks for screen-specific cleanup
- **Loading States**: Built-in loading indicator and disabled state during logout process
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Optional confirmation alert before logout

### 2. Enhanced AuthContext (`/app/context/AuthContext.js`)

- **Prevented Re-initialization**: Added `isInitializedRef` to prevent double initialization
- **Optimized Auth Listener**: Filtered out `INITIAL_SESSION` events to prevent unnecessary updates
- **Centralized Cleanup**: Enhanced `signOut()` method with proper location service cleanup
- **Loading State Management**: Better loading state handling to prevent UI flicker
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with fallback state clearing

### 3. Updated Profile Screen (`/app/(tabs)/profile.js`)

- **Replaced Custom Handler**: Removed local `handleSignOut` function
- **Integrated LogoutButton**: Uses centralized `LogoutButton` component with `primary` variant
- **Simplified Code**: Reduced code complexity and improved maintainability

### 4. Updated Orders Screen (`/app/(tabs)/orders.js`)

- **Replaced Custom Handler**: Removed local `handleLogout` function
- **Integrated LogoutButton**: Uses centralized `LogoutButton` with active order cleanup
- **Optimized Refresh Logic**: Reduced auto-refresh from 5 seconds to 30 seconds
- **Fixed Dependencies**: Corrected useEffect dependencies to prevent refresh loops
- **Streamlined Data Loading**: Removed excessive debug logging to improve performance

### 5. Updated Scanner Screen (`/app/(tabs)/scanner.js`)

- **Added Logout Option**: Integrated `LogoutButton` with `minimal` variant
- **Consistent UI**: Maintains clean scanner interface while providing logout access

## Key Features

### Centralized Logout Behavior

```javascript
// Usage Example
<LogoutButton
  variant="primary"
  size="medium"
  onLogoutStart={async () => {
    // Custom cleanup before logout
    await storage.removeItem("activeOrderId");
  }}
  onLogoutComplete={async () => {
    // Custom actions after logout
    console.log("Logout completed");
  }}
/>
```

### Variants Available

- **Primary**: Red outline button with white background
- **Secondary**: Gray outline button
- **Danger**: Red solid button with white text
- **Minimal**: Transparent background, red text/icon

### App Stability Improvements

1. **Reduced Refresh Frequency**: Auto-refresh changed from 5s to 30s
2. **Stable Dependencies**: Fixed useEffect dependency arrays to prevent loops
3. **Debounced Auth Events**: Filtered redundant auth state changes
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced location service and storage cleanup

## Benefits

### For Users

- **Consistent Experience**: Logout behaves the same across all screens
- **Faster Performance**: Reduced refresh frequency improves battery life and performance
- **Reliable Operation**: No more unexpected app reloads or freezing

### For Developers

- **Maintainable Code**: Single logout component eliminates code duplication
- **Easy Customization**: Variants and callbacks allow screen-specific behavior
- **Better Debugging**: Centralized logout logic easier to troubleshoot
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add logout functionality to new screens

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Cross-Screen Logout**: Test logout from Profile, Orders, and Scanner screens
2. **Location Cleanup**: Verify location tracking stops after logout
3. **Storage Cleanup**: Confirm all stored data is cleared on logout
4. **Auth Redirection**: Ensure proper redirect to login screen after logout

### Performance Testing

1. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks during repeated login/logout cycles
2. **Refresh Loops**: Verify no infinite refresh loops occur
3. **Battery Impact**: Test battery usage with new 30-second refresh interval

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

- **Logout Analytics**: Track logout events for user behavior analysis
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic logout after inactivity period
- **Multi-Device Logout**: Option to sign out from all devices
- **Logout Reason**: Capture reason for logout (manual, error, timeout)

## Integration Notes

### Adding to New Screens

```javascript
import LogoutButton from "../components/LogoutButton";

// In your screen component
<LogoutButton variant="minimal" size="small" showConfirmation={false} />;
```

### Custom Cleanup

```javascript
<LogoutButton
  onLogoutStart={async () => {
    // Screen-specific cleanup
    await clearLocalData();
    await stopServices();
  }}
/>
```

This implementation provides a robust, scalable solution for logout functionality while significantly improving app stability and performance.
