-- INSTRUCTIONS
-- ============================================================================
-- 
-- After running this script:
-- 
-- 1. Check SECTION 1 for inactive drivers
--    - Are there drivers marked as inactive?
--    - When were they updated?
-- 
-- 2. Check SECTION 3 for tenant mismatches
--    - Do any orders show "‚ùå MISMATCH"?
--    - This would cause drivers to disappear from orders
-- 
-- 3. Check SECTION 4 for recent updates
--    - Were any drivers updated recently?
--    - This might indicate automated deactivation
-- 
-- 4. Check SECTION 7 for RLS policies
--    - Are there policies filtering by is_active?
--    - Are there policies filtering by tenant_id?
-- 
-- 5. Check SECTION 8 for triggers
--    - Are there any triggers that might deactivate drivers?
-- 
-- 6. Check SECTION 9 for the main issue
--    - Are there INACTIVE drivers with recent orders?
--    - This is the smoking gun!
-- 
-- Share the results with the development team for analysis.
