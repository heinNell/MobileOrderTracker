# 🚨 URGENT: Dashboard Login Issue Fix

## Problem

You created users via Supabase Authentication UI, but now you can't log in to the dashboard due to a database error.

## Root Cause

When users are created in Supabase Auth (`auth.users`), they need a corresponding entry in your application's `public.users` table with a `tenant_id`. Without this, the Row Level Security (RLS) policies block access.

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic

Execute this in Supabase SQL Editor to see what's broken:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of: DIAGNOSE_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql
```

**What to look for:**

- ❌ "AUTH WITHOUT PUBLIC" - Users in auth but not in public.users
- ⚠️ "USERS WITHOUT TENANT" - Users with NULL tenant_id
- The diagnosis summary at the bottom

### Step 2: Apply the Fix

Execute this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of: FIX_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql
```

**This will:**

1. ✅ Fix the sync trigger to preserve tenant_id
2. ✅ Create missing public.users entries
3. ✅ Assign users to your first active tenant
4. ✅ Show verification results

### Step 3: Try Logging In

Go to your dashboard and try logging in with your credentials.

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

After running `FIX_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql`, you should see:

```
✅ Found 1 active tenant(s)
✅ Step 1 Complete: Trigger fixed
✅ Step 2 Complete: Created X public.users entries assigned to tenant: [UUID]
✅ Step 3 Complete: Fixed X users with NULL tenant_id
🎉 SUCCESS! All users now have tenant assignments and can log in
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### If You Have NO TENANTS:

The script will fail with: `NO ACTIVE TENANTS FOUND!`

**Solution:** Create a tenant first:

```sql
-- Create your first tenant
INSERT INTO public.tenants (id, name, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(),
    'My Company', -- ⬅️ Change this to your company name
    true,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
)
RETURNING id, name;

-- Then re-run FIX_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql
```

### If You Have MULTIPLE TENANTS:

The fix script assigns ALL new users to the FIRST tenant. You may need to manually reassign:

```sql
-- See your tenants
SELECT id, name FROM public.tenants WHERE is_active = true;

-- Reassign a user to correct tenant
UPDATE public.users
SET tenant_id = 'YOUR_TENANT_UUID_HERE'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### If You Need Admin Access:

```sql
-- Make a user an admin
UPDATE public.users
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Issue

### The System Architecture:

```
auth.users (Supabase Auth)
    ↓
    [Trigger: sync_user_from_auth]
    ↓
public.users (Your Application)
    ↓
    [RLS Policies require tenant_id]
    ↓
Dashboard Access
```

### What Went Wrong:

1. **User created in Supabase Auth UI** → Entry in `auth.users` ✅
2. **Trigger fires** → Creates entry in `public.users` ✅
3. **BUT: tenant_id is NULL** → RLS blocks access ❌
4. **Login fails** → Database error 🚨

### What the Fix Does:

1. **Updates trigger** → Preserves tenant_id (won't overwrite existing)
2. **Creates missing profiles** → Links auth.users to public.users
3. **Assigns tenant** → Sets tenant_id so RLS allows access
4. **Verifies setup** → Shows all users are now complete

## 📊 Verification Queries

### Check if fix worked:

```sql
-- Should return 0 rows (no broken users)
SELECT * FROM public.users WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;

-- All users should have complete profiles
SELECT
    u.email,
    u.role,
    t.name as tenant,
    CASE
        WHEN au.id IS NULL THEN '❌ Missing auth'
        WHEN u.tenant_id IS NULL THEN '❌ Missing tenant'
        ELSE '✅ Complete'
    END as status
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = u.id
LEFT JOIN public.tenants t ON t.id = u.tenant_id;
```

## 🚀 Prevention for Future Users

### Option A: Create Users via Dashboard (Recommended)

Use your dashboard's user creation interface - it handles all the linking automatically.

### Option B: Create Users via SQL (Manual)

If you must create users in Supabase Auth UI:

```sql
-- After creating in Auth UI, immediately run:
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, tenant_id, role)
SELECT
    au.id,
    au.email,
    'YOUR_TENANT_UUID', -- ⬅️ Your tenant ID
    'user' -- or 'admin'
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.users pu ON pu.id = au.id
WHERE pu.id IS NULL
AND au.email = 'newuser@example.com';
```

### Option C: Use Edge Function

Create a proper user creation edge function that handles both auth and database setup atomically.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Still Can't Login After Fix?

**Check 1: Email Confirmed?**

```sql
SELECT email, email_confirmed_at
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

If `email_confirmed_at` is NULL, confirm the email in Supabase Auth dashboard.

**Check 2: RLS Policies Enabled?**

```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

**Check 3: User Has Tenant?**

```sql
SELECT u.email, u.tenant_id, t.name as tenant
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN public.tenants t ON t.id = u.tenant_id
WHERE u.email = 'your@email.com';
```

**Check 4: Tenant is Active?**

```sql
SELECT id, name, is_active
FROM public.tenants
WHERE id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM public.users WHERE email = 'your@email.com');
```

### Error: "Role 'anon' does not have permission"

This means RLS is blocking anonymous access. The fix should resolve this, but verify:

```sql
-- Check RLS policies allow authenticated users
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'users'
AND 'authenticated' = ANY(roles);
```

## 📞 Need Help?

If the fix doesn't work:

1. **Run diagnostic again:** `DIAGNOSE_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql`
2. **Check the output** for any remaining issues
3. **Copy the full error message** from your dashboard login attempt
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for JavaScript errors
