-- Fix for missing drivers and transporters from frontend
-- This script diagnoses and fixes RLS policies preventing data visibility

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: CHECK WHAT DATA EXISTS IN THE DATABASE
-- ============================================================================

-- Check drivers in database
SELECT 
  'üìä Drivers in database' as info,
  COUNT(*) as total_drivers,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tenant_id IS NOT NULL) as with_tenant,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tenant_id IS NULL) as without_tenant,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_active = true) as active_drivers
FROM public.drivers;

-- Show sample drivers
SELECT 
  'üë§ Sample Drivers' as info,
  id,
  full_name,
  phone,
  tenant_id,
  is_active,
  created_at
FROM public.drivers
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check transporters in database
SELECT 
  'üöõ Transporters in database' as info,
  COUNT(*) as total_transporters,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tenant_id IS NOT NULL) as with_tenant,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tenant_id IS NULL) as without_tenant
FROM public.transporters;

-- Show sample transporters
SELECT 
  'üè¢ Sample Transporters' as info,
  id,
  company_name,
  tenant_id,
  created_at
FROM public.transporters
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: CHECK CURRENT USER'S TENANT
-- ============================================================================

-- Check current user and their tenant
SELECT 
  'üîë Current User Info' as info,
  id,
  email,
  role,
  tenant_id,
  is_active
FROM public.users
WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 3: CHECK RLS POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Check RLS status
SELECT 
  'üîí RLS Status' as info,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('drivers', 'transporters')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Check all policies on drivers
SELECT 
  'üìã Policies on drivers table' as info,
  policyname,
  cmd as operation,
  roles,
  qual as using_clause,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'drivers'
ORDER BY cmd;

-- Check all policies on transporters
SELECT 
  'üìã Policies on transporters table' as info,
  policyname,
  cmd as operation,
  roles,
  qual as using_clause,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'transporters'
ORDER BY cmd;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 4: FIX NULL TENANT IDS
-- ============================================================================

-- Get the first available tenant (or create one if none exists)
DO $$
DECLARE
  default_tenant_id uuid;
BEGIN
  -- Try to get an existing tenant
  SELECT id INTO default_tenant_id FROM public.tenants LIMIT 1;
  
  -- If no tenant exists, create one
  IF default_tenant_id IS NULL THEN
    INSERT INTO public.tenants (name, is_active)
    VALUES ('Default Organization', true)
    RETURNING id INTO default_tenant_id;
    
    RAISE NOTICE 'Created default tenant: %', default_tenant_id;
  END IF;
  
  -- Update drivers with NULL tenant_id
  UPDATE public.drivers
  SET tenant_id = default_tenant_id
  WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;
  
  -- Update transporters with NULL tenant_id
  UPDATE public.transporters
  SET tenant_id = default_tenant_id
  WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;
  
  -- Update users with NULL tenant_id
  UPDATE public.users
  SET tenant_id = default_tenant_id
  WHERE tenant_id IS NULL;
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'Updated NULL tenant_ids to: %', default_tenant_id;
END $$;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 5: FIX RLS POLICIES FOR DRIVERS
-- ============================================================================

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.drivers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage drivers" ON public.drivers;

-- Create comprehensive SELECT policy (view drivers)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view drivers in their tenant"

FOR SELECT

-- Allow service role full access

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 6: FIX RLS POLICIES FOR TRANSPORTERS
-- ============================================================================

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.transporters ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (

-- Allow service role full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access to transporters"

-- Allow authenticated users to insert transporters in their tenant

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 7: VERIFICATION
-- ============================================================================

-- Verify drivers are now visible
SELECT

-- Show final policy summary

FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND tablename IN ('drivers', 'transporters')
GROUP BY tablename

-- Show sample data that should be visible

LEFT JOIN public.tenants t ON d.tenant_id = t.id
WHERE d.tenant_id IN (
  SELECT tenant_id FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid()
