# 📍 How to Access Customer Tracking Links - Quick Guide

## ✅ Solution Implemented!

I've added **two easy ways** to get the customer tracking link from the Orders page:

---

## Method 1: 🔗 Track Button (Opens Modal)

### Location:

**Orders Page → Actions Column**

### What You See:

For any order with status `in_progress`, `in_transit`, or `loaded`, you'll see:

```
Actions Column:
├── 🧪 (Debug QR)
├── Edit
├── 🔗 Track     ← NEW! Click this
├── 📍 View      ← NEW! Direct link
├── Delete
├── PDF
└── View
```

### Steps:

1. Go to **Orders** page
2. Find any active order (in_progress/in_transit/loaded status)
3. Click the **"🔗 Track"** button (blue)
4. A beautiful modal pops up with:
   - Full tracking link displayed
   - **Copy Link** button (one-click copy to clipboard)
   - **Open Link** button (opens tracking page in new tab)
   - **Email** button (opens email with pre-filled message)
   - Info about tracking features

### Features of the Modal:

- ✅ Large, easy-to-read tracking link
- ✅ Three action buttons (Copy, Open, Email)
- ✅ Professional design
- ✅ Mobile-friendly
- ✅ Shows feature description

---

## Method 2: 📍 View Button (Direct Access)

### Location:

**Orders Page → Actions Column** (next to 🔗 Track button)

### Steps:

1. Go to **Orders** page
2. Find any active order
3. Click the **"📍 View"** button (indigo color)
4. Opens the customer tracking page directly in a new tab

This is perfect for:

- Quickly checking what the customer will see
- Testing the tracking page
- Viewing live location immediately

---

## Tracking Link Format

The link that gets generated looks like this:

```
https://your-dashboard-url.com/tracking/[ORDER-UUID]/public
```

**Example:**

```
https://dashboard.vercel.app/tracking/abc-123-456-def/public
```

**Features of the Public Tracking Page:**

- ✅ No login required
- ✅ Live driver location on map
- ✅ Complete route history (polyline)
- ✅ Trip analytics:
  - Distance traveled (km)
  - Trip duration (hours:minutes)
  - Average speed (km/h)
- ✅ Auto-refreshes every 10 minutes
- ✅ Real-time updates via Supabase
- ✅ Order details (driver, loading/unloading points)
- ✅ Last update timestamp
- ✅ Professional, mobile-friendly design

## Why Locations Might Not Show

### Issue: "My App is updating location but it doesn't show on tracking page"

### Quick Diagnosis:

#### 1. Did you run the SQL script?

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Check if tracking system is deployed
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name = 'get_tracking_data';
```

**Expected:** Should return 1 row

**If NO rows:** Run `COMPLETE_TRACKING_SYSTEM.sql` file in Supabase

#### 2. Is tracking activated for the order?

**Check:**

```sql
SELECT
    order_number,
    status,
    tracking_active,
    last_driver_location
FROM orders
WHERE status IN ('in_progress', 'in_transit', 'loaded');
```

**Expected:**

- `tracking_active` = TRUE
- `last_driver_location` = JSON with lat/lng data

**If tracking_active is FALSE:**

```sql
-- Fix it:
UPDATE orders
SET tracking_active = TRUE, trip_start_time = NOW()
WHERE status IN ('in_progress', 'in_transit', 'loaded')
AND tracking_active != TRUE;
```

#### 3. Are locations actually being saved?

**Check:**

```sql
SELECT
    created_at,
    driver_id,
    order_id,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    geometry
FROM driver_locations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**What to look for:**

- ✅ Recent timestamps (within last few hours)
- ✅ Latitude and longitude have values (not NULL)
- ✅ Geometry column says "POINT(...)" or has data
- ✅ order_id matches your active order

**If latitude/longitude are NULL:**

- Issue with mobile app's LocationService
- Check mobile app console for errors

**If geometry is NULL but lat/lng exist:**

```sql
-- Backfill geometry:
UPDATE driver_locations
SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326)
WHERE latitude IS NOT NULL
  AND longitude IS NOT NULL
  AND geometry IS NULL;
```

#### 4. Test the tracking API directly

**Run this:**

```sql
-- Replace 'your-order-id' with actual order UUID
SELECT * FROM get_tracking_data('your-order-id');
```

**Expected:** Should return 1 row with all tracking data

**If NO rows:** Order not found or not trackable

**If ERROR:** RPC function not created - run SQL script

## Complete Fix Workflow

### Step 1: Deploy Database Changes

```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
# 1. Open COMPLETE_TRACKING_SYSTEM.sql
# 2. Copy entire contents
# 3. Paste and click "Run"
# 4. Wait for success message
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

```sql
-- Run these checks:
SELECT COUNT(*) as tracking_functions
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name IN ('get_tracking_data', 'calculate_trip_analytics');
-- Should return 2

SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'driver_locations'
AND column_name = 'geometry';
-- Should return 'geometry'

SELECT COUNT(*) as trackable_orders
FROM orders
WHERE tracking_active = TRUE;
-- Should return count of active orders
```

### Step 3: Activate Tracking

```sql
-- Auto-activate for all in-progress orders:
UPDATE orders
SET
    tracking_active = TRUE,
    trip_start_time = COALESCE(trip_start_time, NOW())
WHERE status IN ('in_progress', 'in_transit', 'loaded')
AND (tracking_active IS NULL OR tracking_active = FALSE);
```

### Step 4: Test Mobile App

1. Open mobile app
2. Go to an active order
3. Send location update
4. Check console for: "📍 Location updated"
5. Verify no errors

### Step 5: Check Database

```sql
-- Verify location was saved:
SELECT * FROM driver_locations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Step 6: Access Tracking Link

1. Go to Orders page in dashboard
2. Find order with active status
3. Click **"🔗 Track"** button
4. Modal appears with link
5. Click **"Open Link"** or **"Copy Link"**

### Step 7: Verify Tracking Page

1. Open tracking link
2. Should see:
   - ✅ Map with driver location marker
   - ✅ Route polyline (if multiple locations)
   - ✅ Order details
   - ✅ Trip analytics (distance, time, speed)
   - ✅ Last update timestamp

## Mobile App Checklist

### Verify LocationService is Working:

Look for these in mobile app console:

**Good Signs:**

```
📍 Processing location update: {orderId: '...'}
📍 Location updated: {orderId: '...', lat: ..., lng: ...}
✅ Validation passed
```

**Bad Signs:**

```
Error saving location: {...}
⚠️ Order not found, setting order_id to null
Error sending immediate location update
```

### If Locations Aren't Sending:

1. **Check permissions:** Location permission granted?
2. **Check network:** Is app online?
3. **Check order:** Is order activated in app?
4. **Check console:** Any error messages?

## Dashboard Verification

### What You Should See:

**On Orders Page (for active orders):**

- Blue **"🔗 Track"** button
- Indigo **"📍 View"** button
- Both appear in Actions column

**When You Click 🔗 Track:**

- Large modal with tracking link
- Three buttons: Copy Link, Open Link, Email
- Feature description text
- Close button (X)

**Public Tracking Page:**

- Map centered on driver location
- Green marker for current position
- Blue polyline showing route
- Order details card
- Trip analytics card
- Auto-refresh info
- Professional branding

---

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue 1: "🔗 Track button doesn't appear"

**Cause:** Order status not active

**Fix:** Change order status to `in_progress`, `in_transit`, or `loaded`

### Issue 2: "Tracking page shows 'Tracking Not Available'"

**Cause:** `tracking_active` = FALSE

**Fix:**

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET tracking_active = TRUE
WHERE id = 'your-order-id';
```

### Issue 3: "Map loads but no driver marker"

**Cause:** No location data or geometry is NULL

**Fix:**

```sql
-- Check if locations exist:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM driver_locations WHERE order_id = 'your-order-id';

-- If count > 0 but map is empty, backfill geometry:
UPDATE driver_locations
SET geometry = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326)
WHERE order_id = 'your-order-id' AND geometry IS NULL;
```

### Issue 4: "Distance/Time show 0 or NULL"

**Cause:** Not enough location points or tracking just started

**Requirements:**

- At least 2 location points
- Some time must pass
- `trip_start_time` must be set

**Fix:**

```sql
-- Force recalculate:
SELECT * FROM calculate_trip_analytics('your-order-id');

-- Apply to order:
UPDATE orders o
SET
    total_distance_km = t.total_distance_km,
    total_duration_minutes = t.total_duration_minutes,
    average_speed_kmh = t.average_speed_kmh
FROM calculate_trip_analytics(o.id) t
WHERE o.id = 'your-order-id';
```
