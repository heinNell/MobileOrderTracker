Please write detailed API documentation for Google Maps integrations, covering API keys/env vars, endpoints (Directions, Geocoding, Places), request params (origin/destination, waypoints), response parsing for routes/polylines, real-time location updates, geofence overlays, and client-side examples (@react-google-maps/api for dashboard, react-native-maps for mobile). Include quota management and error handling.
