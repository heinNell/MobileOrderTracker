Please write detailed API documentation for order management via Supabase, including endpoints (POST /orders, GET /orders?filter=status, PATCH /orders/:id, DELETE /orders/:id), request/response JSON schemas (fields like id, status, route, geofence_id), filtering/sorting/pagination, real-time updates, error handling (validation, concurrency), and examples linking to QR codes and driver assignments.
