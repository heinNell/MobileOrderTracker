# Order Management Enhancements Summary

## Overview

This document outlines all the enhancements made to the order management system to address user requirements for multi-currency support, expected date fields, order editing improvements, and Excel export functionality.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Expected Loading/Unloading Date Fields

**Files Modified:**

- `dashboard/app/components/EnhancedOrderForm.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added `expected_loading_date` and `expected_unloading_date` to formData state
- Created two new date input fields in the Basic Information tab:
  - **Expected Loading Date** - When should loading begin?
  - **Expected Unloading Date** - Expected delivery completion date
- Both fields use HTML5 `<input type="date">` for native date picker
- Fields are marked with orange star (‚òÖ) to indicate importance
- Dates are included in order submission via `handleSubmit`
- When editing an order, these fields are pre-filled from the existing order data

**Database Support:**

- The `orders` table already has these columns defined in `shared/types.ts`:
  - `expected_loading_date?: string`
  - `expected_unloading_date?: string`

**Benefits:**

- Enables better load planning and scheduling
- Provides visibility into expected pickup and delivery timelines
- Supports filtering and sorting by expected dates (can be added in future)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Multi-Currency Support (USD and ZAR)

**Files Modified:**

- `dashboard/app/components/EnhancedOrderForm.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Updated the Currency dropdown in the Transporter tab
- Reordered options to prioritize USD and ZAR:
  1. **USD - US Dollar** (primary)
  2. **ZAR - South African Rand** (primary)
  3. EUR - Euro
  4. GBP - British Pound
  5. NGN - Nigerian Naira
  6. KES - Kenyan Shilling

**Features:**

- Currency is stored in `transporter_supplier.cost_currency` field
- Defaults to "USD" if not specified
- Full currency names displayed for clarity
- Supports any of the 6 currencies listed

**Database Support:**

- Uses existing `rate_currency` and `cost_currency` fields from types
- No database changes required

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Order Editing Data Retention Fix

**Files Modified:**

- `dashboard/app/components/EnhancedOrderForm.tsx`

**Problem:**
When editing an order, the transporter and contact selections were not retained - only the manual text fields were populated. This made it appear as if no transporter/contact was selected.

**Solution:**
Enhanced the `useEffect` hook that initializes the form when editing to:

```typescript
// Restore selected transporter state if it exists
if (order.transporter_supplier?.name) {
  const mockTransporter: EnhancedTransporter = {
    id: "",
    tenant_id: order.tenant_id,
    name: order.transporter_supplier.name,
    primary_contact_phone: order.transporter_supplier.contact_phone,
    primary_contact_email: order.transporter_supplier.contact_email,
    // ... other fields
  };
  setSelectedTransporter(mockTransporter);
}

// Restore selected contact state if it exists
if (order.contact_name) {
  const mockContact: EnhancedContact = {
    id: "",
    tenant_id: order.tenant_id,
    full_name: order.contact_name,
    first_name: order.contact_name.split(" ")[0] || "",
    last_name: order.contact_name.split(" ").slice(1).join(" ") || "",
    primary_phone: order.contact_phone,
    // ... other fields
  };
  setSelectedCustomerContact(mockContact);
}
```

**Benefits:**

- When editing an order, the selected transporter and contact now appear in their respective selection boxes
- Green highlight boxes show the previously selected items
- Users can see what was selected and change it if needed
- Prevents confusion about whether a transporter/contact was assigned

**Note:**

- The mock objects don't have the full database IDs since we only store the names/phones in the order
- This is sufficient for display purposes
- If user wants to change the selection, they can click the X to remove and select a different one

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

The following SQL scripts still need to be executed in Supabase SQL Editor:

### 1. Contact Field Mapping (Optional but Recommended)

**File:** `FIX_CONTACTS_NAME_EMAIL_MAPPING.sql`

**Purpose:** Syncs legacy `name` and `email` columns with new `first_name`, `last_name`, and `primary_email` fields

**Instructions:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `FIX_CONTACTS_NAME_EMAIL_MAPPING.sql`
3. Paste and run in SQL Editor
4. Verify: Create a new contact and check that `name` field is auto-populated

### 2. Auto Order Number Generation (Optional but Recommended)

**File:** `ADD_AUTO_ORDER_NUMBER_GENERATION.sql`

**Purpose:** Automatically generates order numbers in format `ORD-YYYYMMDD-####`

**Instructions:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `ADD_AUTO_ORDER_NUMBER_GENERATION.sql`
3. Paste and run in SQL Editor
4. Verify: Create a new order without specifying order_number - it should auto-generate

**Note:** The current order creation already generates order numbers in code (`ORD-${Date.now()}`), so this SQL is optional but provides better format and database-level generation.

## Troubleshooting

### Excel Export Not Working

**Symptom:** Button disabled or error message

**Solutions:**

- Check if there are any filtered orders (button is disabled when list is empty)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify xlsx library is installed: `npm list xlsx`
- Try refreshing the page

### Expected Dates Not Saving

**Symptom:** Dates entered but not visible when viewing order

**Solutions:**

- Check that dates are entered in correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Verify date fields have values before submitting form
- Check browser console for validation errors
- Confirm database has `expected_loading_date` and `expected_unloading_date` columns

### Currency Not Displaying Correctly in Excel

**Symptom:** Currency shows as "undefined" or empty

**Solutions:**

- Ensure currency is selected when creating order
- Check that `transporter_supplier.cost_currency` field exists
- Verify transporter cost amount is a valid number

### Transporter/Contact Not Showing When Editing

**Symptom:** Edit form shows empty even though order has transporter/contact

**Solutions:**

- Check that order has `transporter_supplier.name` or `contact_name` populated
- Verify the useEffect hook is running (check browser console logs)
- Try refreshing the page and editing again
- Check that `isEditing` prop is set to `true`

---

## Performance Notes

- Excel export is done client-side, so large exports (1000+ orders) may take a few seconds
- Date fields are simple inputs with no heavy date libraries needed
- Currency dropdown is static, no API calls
- Edit mode restoration creates lightweight mock objects, minimal memory usage

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Date Range Filtering:** Add ability to filter orders by expected loading/unloading date ranges
2. **Currency Conversion:** Show costs in multiple currencies with real-time conversion
3. **CSV Export:** Alternative to Excel for systems that prefer CSV
4. **Email Export:** Send Excel reports via email
5. **Scheduled Reports:** Automatically export and send reports daily/weekly
6. **Custom Export Templates:** Let users choose which columns to include
7. **Date Reminders:** Notify users when expected loading date is approaching
