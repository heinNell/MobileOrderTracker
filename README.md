This ensures scalability for annual growth, with best practices drawn from recent logistics app development guides, such as using dynamic QR codes for analytics and real-time integrations for operational efficiency.

The tech stack remains Supabase for backend, Flutter for mobile (now leveraging AI integrations for faster prototyping and real-time performance analysis), and Next.js for the dashboard. We'll emphasize offline-first design with batching for location updates, dynamic QR codes for better tracking performance, and AR navigation options for enhanced driver experience in complex routes.

#### 1. Backend Setup with Supabase

Create a Supabase project at supabase.com, enabling the latest features like Supavisor for scaling to millions of connections (ideal for high-frequency tracking) and the AI Assistant for observability to monitor logs and alerts in real-time. Use RSA asymmetric keys for authentication in new projects, and integrate the official MCP server for AI-enhanced debugging if needed.

##### Database Schema (Postgres SQL)

The schema supports tenant isolation via RLS and partitioned tables for growth. Add geospatial indexes for efficient route optimization queries.

```sql
-- Users table (extended from Supabase Auth)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('driver', 'dispatcher', 'admin')),
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Orders table with geospatial support
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    order_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    skus JSONB NOT NULL,
    loading_point GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
    unloading_point GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
    time_window_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    time_window_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    handling_instructions TEXT,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'active', 'completed', 'canceled')),
    driver_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX orders_loading_gix ON orders USING GIST (loading_point);
CREATE INDEX orders_unloading_gix ON orders USING GIST (unloading_point);

-- QR Codes table (dynamic with analytics)
CREATE TABLE qr_codes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    qr_payload TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Signed JWT with analytics hook
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    revoked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    scan_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- For performance tracking
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Locations table (batched inserts for scalability)
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id),
    driver_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    position GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    speed FLOAT,
    heading FLOAT
);
CREATE INDEX locations_position_gix ON locations USING GIST (position);
PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);  -- For growth planning

-- Messages and Audit tables (similar, with Realtime enabled)
-- ...
```

Enable RLS policies for all tables, e.g.:

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Tenant isolation" ON orders FOR ALL USING (tenant_id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()));
```

##### Authentication & Security

Use Supabase Auth with JWT (RSA keys post-May 2025) and biometric integration. Implement jailbreak detection in mobile. For QR, use JWS signatures with short-lived tokens.

##### Edge Functions (Deno 2.1)

Deploy with Deno 2.1 for better performance. Example QR generation (dynamic for analytics):

```typescript
// qr_generate.ts (Deno 2.1)
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.200.0/http/server.ts"; // Updated std lib
import { create } from "https://deno.land/x/qrcode@v2.0.0/mod.ts";
import { supabaseClient } from "./supabase.ts";

serve(async (req) => {
  const { order_id, expires_in } = await req.json();
  const token = await signJWS(
    { order_id },
    Deno.env.get("SECRET_KEY"),
    expires_in
  );
  const qrData = await create(token, { errorCorrectionLevel: "H" });
  const { error } = await supabaseClient
    .from("qr_codes")
    .insert({
      order_id,
      qr_payload: token,
      expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + expires_in),
    });
  if (error) return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error }), { status: 500 });
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ qr_base64: qrData }), { status: 200 });
});

// signJWS function using crypto.subtle (enhanced security)
async function signJWS(payload: object, secret: string, expiresIn: number) {
  // Implement with RSA keys
}
```

For validation, add scan_count increment for QR performance tracking.

##### Scalability

Use Supavisor for connection pooling, read replicas, and batching/compression for location updates (e.g., via Edge Functions limiting to 10-30s intervals). Leverage realtime channels with backpressure management.

#### 2. Mobile Application (Flutter 3.35)

Use Flutter 3.35 for cross-platform, with Create with AI for rapid UI prototyping of order views and real-time analysis for battery-optimized tracking. Integrate google_maps_flutter 3.x with 3D support and AR navigation for routes. Add SensitiveContent widget for privacy in incident reporting.

class _QRScannerState extends State<QRScanner> {
  // ...
  void _onQRViewCreated(QRViewController controller) {
    controller.scannedDataStream.listen((scanData) async {
      final payload = scanData.code;
      try {
        final response = await http.post(Uri.parse('https://your-supabase-url/functions/v1/qr_validate'), body: {'qr_payload': payload});
        if (response.statusCode == 200) {
          final order = jsonDecode(response.body);
          // Update scan_count via Supabase
          await Supabase.instance.client.from('qr_codes').update({'scan_count': FieldValue.increment(1)}).eq('qr_payload', payload);
          Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => OrderDetail(order)));
        }
      } catch (e) {
        // Offline: Queue in local storage (e.g., Hive)
      }
    });
  }
}
```

- **Navigation with 3D/AR**:

```dart
import 'package:google_maps_flutter/google_maps_flutter.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void launchARNavigation(LatLng start, LatLng end) async {
  final url = 'https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=${start.latitude},${start.longitude}&destination=${end.latitude},${end.longitude}&travelmode=driving&layer=traffic&mode=AR';  // AR mode
  if (await canLaunchUrl(Uri.parse(url))) await launchUrl(Uri.parse(url));
}
```

- **Background Tracking (Optimized)**:
  Use geolocator with batching; integrate Flutter's real-time performance analysis for tuning.

```dart
// Similar to previous, but with compression
await Supabase.instance.client.from('locations').insert(compressBatch(locations));  // Custom compress function
```

### QR Code Generation Details in the Logistics Dashboard (2025 Edition)

The QR code generation feature in the centralized dashboard is a core component for order management, enabling dispatchers and admins to create unique, secure QR codes tied to each logistics order. These codes encapsulate order metadata (e.g., ID, loading/unloading points) in a signed payload, facilitating instant retrieval via mobile scanning while supporting digital sharing (e.g., email/PDF) and physical printing. As of October 2025, the implementation draws from the latest best practices for security, usability, and branding, such as integrating company colors and fonts for visual consistency, using short-lived signed tokens to prevent tampering, and providing clear contextual instructions alongside the code to guide users. This ensures the codes are not only functional but also secure against common threats like phishing or data injection, aligning with broader web application security guidelines like input validation and encryption for sensitive data.

Built on Next.js 15 with Supabase integration, the feature emphasizes scalability (e.g., handling bulk generations) and mobile compatibility‚ÄîQR previews and downloads work seamlessly on smaller screens via responsive modals. For generation, we leverage server-side processing in Supabase Edge Functions (Deno 2.1) to avoid exposing secrets in the frontend, combined with client-side styling for branded previews.

#### Key Implementation Details

- **Workflow**: QR codes are generated automatically upon order creation or manually via a dedicated button in the order details view. Users can set expiration (e.g., 24-72 hours) and revocation options, with the system storing metadata in the `qr_codes` table for tracking scan counts and audit trails. This supports analytics, such as monitoring scan frequency to detect anomalies.
- **Security Measures**: Payloads use JWS (JSON Web Signatures) with RSA keys for tamper-proofing, ensuring only valid scans fetch order details. Avoid third-party scanners by recommending built-in camera apps, and include visual checks (e.g., domain previews) to prevent malicious codes.
- **Branding and Usability**: Incorporate tenant-specific colors, logos, and fonts using libraries like `qr-code-styling` for customizable outputs. Provide contextual text like "Scan to activate order ORD-123" to improve user experience.
- **Formats and Sharing**: Generate in SVG/PNG for digital sharing or printable PDFs (via jsPDF) with batch options for multiple orders. Expiration triggers automatic revocation in the database.
- **Performance**: Edge Functions handle generation off the main thread, with caching for repeated views. For high-volume growth, use batched inserts to Supabase.

#### Code Implementation

##### Supabase Edge Function for Generation (Deno 2.1)

This serverless function signs the payload and generates the QR, now enhanced with styling options for branding.

```typescript
// qr_generate.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.200.0/http/server.ts";
import { create } from "https://deno.land/x/qrcode@v2.0.0/mod.ts"; // Base QR generation
import { supabaseClient } from "./supabase.ts";

serve(async (req) => {
  const { order_id, expires_in, branding } = await req.json(); // branding: { color: '#000', logo: 'url' }
  const payload = { order_id, exp: Date.now() + expires_in };
  const token = await signJWS(payload, Deno.env.get("RSA_PRIVATE_KEY")); // RSA for 2025 security standards
  const qrOptions = {
    errorCorrectionLevel: "H",
    color: { dark: branding?.color || "#000" },
    // Integrate qr-code-styling logic here for logo overlay if needed
  };
  const qrData = await create(token, qrOptions);
  const { error } = await supabaseClient.from("qr_codes").insert({
    order_id,
    qr_payload: token,
    expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + expires_in),
    scan_count: 0, // For analytics
  });
  if (error) return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error }), { status: 500 });
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ qr_base64: qrData.toDataURL(), token }),
    { status: 200 }
  );
});

// signJWS: Use crypto.subtle with RSA for enhanced security
async function signJWS(payload: object, privateKey: string) {
  // Implementation with RSA-PSS or similar
}
```

##### Dashboard Integration (Next.js Page Snippet)

In `/app/dashboard/orders/[id]/page.tsx`, trigger generation and display previews. Use `qr-code-styling` on client-side for interactive styling previews.

```tsx
"use client";
import { useSupabaseClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-react";
import { QRCodeStyling } from "qr-code-styling"; // Installed via npm
import { useState, useRef } from "react";
import jsPDF from "jspdf";

export default function OrderQR({ orderId }) {
  const supabase = useSupabaseClient();
  const [qrData, setQrData] = useState(null);
  const qrRef = useRef(null);

  const generateQR = async () => {
    const { data } = await fetch("/api/qr_generate", {
      // Proxy to Edge Function
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        order_id: orderId,
        expires_in: 86400000,
        branding: { color: "#007BFF" },
      }),
    }).then((res) => res.json());
    setQrData(data.qr_base64);

    // Style and preview
    const qr = new QRCodeStyling({
      width: 300,
      height: 300,
      data: data.token,
      image: "/logo.png", // Tenant logo
      dotsOptions: { color: "#007BFF" },
    });
    qr.append(qrRef.current);
  };

  const downloadPDF = () => {
    const doc = new jsPDF();
    doc.addImage(qrData, "PNG", 10, 10, 180, 180);
    doc.text("Scan to activate order", 10, 200);
    doc.save(`order_${orderId}.pdf`);
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">
      <button onClick={generateQR} className="btn">
        Generate QR
      </button>
      {qrData && (
        <>
          <div ref={qrRef} className="qr-preview" />
          <button onClick={downloadPDF}>Download Printable PDF</button>
          <p>Expires in 24 hours. Revoke if needed.</p>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Analytics and Monitoring

Post-generation, the dashboard includes a analytics section tracking scans (via `scan_count` updates on validation), locations, and devices‚Äîmirroring modern QR platforms for insights into usage patterns. Integrate Realtime subscriptions to update metrics live.

This setup ensures QR generation is secure, user-friendly, and scalable for logistics growth, with options for AI-enhanced customization if expanded (e.g., via tools like qrGPT). For further tweaks, like advanced styling, refer to the latest libraries.

### QR Code Scanning Integration in the Mobile Application (2025 Edition)

The QR code scanning integration empowers drivers in the logistics mobile app to activate orders instantly by capturing pre-generated QR codes using the device's camera. This feature is built into the Flutter-based app, aligning with the system's offline-first design to handle intermittent connectivity‚Äîscanning occurs locally, while order retrieval and validation are queued for sync when online. As of October 2025, we recommend using the `mobile_scanner` package (latest version 5.2.1) for its superior performance, real-time detection, and cross-platform support (Android via CameraX/MLKit, iOS via AVFoundation), outperforming older options like `qr_code_scanner` which is now in maintenance mode. It supports multiple barcode formats (including QR), torch control, zoom, and custom overlays for a polished UI, ensuring compatibility with Flutter 3.35+ and enhanced battery efficiency for logistics use cases.

Integration seamlessly ties into Supabase for secure payload validation via Edge Functions, fetching order details only after signature verification. For offline scenarios, scans are processed locally, with payloads queued in local storage (e.g., using Hive) for automatic retry upon reconnection‚Äîpreventing data loss in remote areas. This meets the spec's requirements for instant retrieval, access controls, and resilience.

#### Key Implementation Details

- **Package Installation**: Add `mobile_scanner: ^5.2.1` and `hive: ^2.2.3` (for offline queuing) via `flutter pub add`. Request camera permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml` (`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>`) and `Info.plist` (`<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key><string>Access to scan QR codes for orders</string>`).
- **Workflow**: Launch the scanner UI from a button (e.g., "Scan Order"). On detection, extract the signed payload, attempt validation via HTTP to the Supabase Edge Function. If offline, queue in Hive and notify the user; sync on connectivity using `connectivity_plus` package.
- **Security**: Only process valid QR formats; validate signatures client-side if public keys are available (optional for speed), but always server-verify for full security.
- **UI Customization**: Overlay a scanning frame, instructions ("Align QR code"), and haptic feedback on success for better UX in 2025 standards.
- **Performance**: Real-time scanning at 30-60 FPS; auto-focus and torch for low-light logistics environments. Supports front/back camera switching.
- **Offline Fallback**: Use Hive to store scanned payloads with timestamps; a background service (via `workmanager`) retries validation periodically.

#### Code Implementation

##### Scanner Widget (Dart)

Embed the `MobileScanner` widget in a stateful page, handling detection and offline logic.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mobile_scanner/mobile_scanner.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';
import 'dart:convert';

class QRScannerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const QRScannerPage({super.key});

  @override
  _QRScannerPageState createState() => _QRScannerPageState();
}

class _QRScannerPageState extends State<QRScannerPage> {
  MobileScannerController controller = MobileScannerController(
    detectionSpeed: DetectionSpeed.normal, // Balance speed/battery
    facing: CameraFacing.back,
    torchEnabled: false,
  );
  Box? offlineQueue; // Hive box for offline storage

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initHive();
  }

  Future<void> _initHive() async {
    await Hive.initFlutter();
    offlineQueue = await Hive.openBox('offline_scans');
  }

  void _onDetect(BarcodeCapture capture) {
    final List<Barcode> barcodes = capture.barcodes;
    for (final barcode in barcodes) {
      if (barcode.format == BarcodeFormat.qrCode && barcode.rawValue != null) {
        final payload = barcode.rawValue!;
        _processPayload(payload);
        controller.stop(); // Stop after successful scan
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  Future<void> _processPayload(String payload) async {
    try {
      final response = await http.post(
        Uri.parse('https://your-supabase-url/functions/v1/qr_validate'),
        headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ${Supabase.instance.client.auth.currentSession?.accessToken}'},
        body: jsonEncode({'qr_payload': payload}),
      );
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        final order = jsonDecode(response.body);
        // Update scan_count and navigate to OrderDetail
        await Supabase.instance.client.from('qr_codes').update({'scan_count': FieldValue.increment(1)}).eq('qr_payload', payload);
        Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => OrderDetail(order)));
      } else {
        _queueOffline(payload);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      _queueOffline(payload);
    }
  }

  void _queueOffline(String payload) {
    offlineQueue?.add({'payload': payload, 'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()});
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(const SnackBar(content: Text('Offline: Scan queued for sync')));
    // Trigger background sync later via workmanager
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Scan QR Code')),
      body: Stack(
        children: [
          MobileScanner(
            controller: controller,
            onDetect: _onDetect,
          ),
          Align(
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            child: Container(
              width: 250,
              height: 250,
              decoration: BoxDecoration(
                border: Border.all(color: Colors.red, width: 2),
                borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
              ),
            ),
          ), // Custom overlay frame
          Positioned(
            bottom: 20,
            left: 20,
            child: IconButton(
              icon: const Icon(Icons.flash_on),
              onPressed: () => controller.toggleTorch(),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

##### Background Sync (Optional Enhancement)

Use `workmanager` to periodically check connectivity and process queued scans.

```dart
import 'package:workmanager/workmanager.dart';

void callbackDispatcher() {
  Workmanager().executeTask((task, inputData) async {
    // Check connectivity, process offlineQueue
    return Future.value(true);
  });
}

// In main.dart: Workmanager().initialize(callbackDispatcher);
```

This integration ensures robust, user-friendly scanning tailored for logistics, with seamless Supabase tie-in and growth-ready scalability. For custom UI overlays or AR enhancements (new in 2025 Flutter), extend the widget as needed. If expanding to barcode support beyond QR, `mobile_scanner` handles it natively.

### Barcode Scanning Integration in the Mobile Application (2025 Edition)

The barcode scanning feature extends the logistics mobile app's capabilities, allowing drivers to scan product barcodes (e.g., for SKUs during loading/unloading) to verify inventory, update order statuses, or report discrepancies in real-time. This complements the existing QR code scanning for order activation, enabling comprehensive handling of both 1D barcodes (like EAN, Code128) and 2D codes (like QR) within the same interface. As of October 2025, we recommend the `ai_barcode_scanner` package (version 7.1.0) for its AI-enhanced detection using MLKit, which improves accuracy in varied lighting conditions common in logistics environments. Built on `mobile_scanner`, it supports multiple formats, real-time scanning, and cross-platform performance on Android (CameraX) and iOS (AVFoundation), with offline fallback for queuing scans. For commercial-grade precision, alternatives like Scanbot SDK offer AI-powered scanning, but `ai_barcode_scanner` provides a free, open-source solution suitable for scalable growth.




#### Key Implementation Details
- **Package Installation**: Add `ai_barcode_scanner: ^7.1.0` via `flutter pub add`. Ensure camera permissions are set (as in QR scanning). It depends on `mobile_scanner` internally, so no additional installs needed.
- **Workflow**: Launch from order detail view (e.g., "Scan SKU"). On detection, validate the barcode against order metadata (e.g., match SKUs), update Supabase (e.g., mark as loaded), and handle offline queuing with Hive for sync.
- **Security and Usability**: Restrict to authenticated drivers; use AI for robust detection. Customize UI with overlays, torch, and zoom for warehouse use.
- **Supported Formats**: Includes QR, Code39, Code128, EAN8/13, UPC-A/E, PDF417, etc.‚Äîideal for logistics SKUs.
- **Offline Fallback**: Queue scanned data locally; integrate with background sync for resilience.
- **Performance**: Real-time at high FPS; AI reduces false positives in busy scenes.

#### Code Implementation
##### Barcode Scanner Widget (Dart)
Adapt the QR scanner to handle barcodes, processing detections similarly but checking formats.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ai_barcode_scanner/ai_barcode_scanner.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:hive/hive.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';
import 'dart:convert';

class BarcodeScannerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  final String orderId; // Pass order ID for context
  const BarcodeScannerPage({super.key, required this.orderId});

  @override
  _BarcodeScannerPageState createState() => _BarcodeScannerPageState();
}

class _BarcodeScannerPageState extends State<BarcodeScannerPage> {
  Box? offlineQueue;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _initHive();
  }

  Future<void> _initHive() async {
    await Hive.initFlutter();
    offlineQueue = await Hive.openBox('offline_scans');
  }

  void _onDetect(String? code, MobileScannerArguments? args) {
    if (code != null) {
      _processBarcode(code);
    }
  }

  Future<void> _processBarcode(String code) async {
    // Validate against order SKUs (fetch from Supabase or local)
    try {
      final response = await http.post(
        Uri.parse('https://your-supabase-url/functions/v1/barcode_validate'),
        headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer ${Supabase.instance.client.auth.currentSession?.accessToken}'},
        body: jsonEncode({'barcode': code, 'order_id': widget.orderId}),
      );
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        // Update order status, e.g., mark SKU as scanned
        await Supabase.instance.client.from('orders').update({'skus_scanned': code}).eq('id', widget.orderId);
        ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Barcode $code validated!')));
        Navigator.pop(context);
      } else {
        _queueOffline(code);
      }
    } catch (e) {
      _queueOffline(code);
    }
  }

  void _queueOffline(String code) {
    offlineQueue?.add({'barcode': code, 'order_id': widget.orderId, 'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()});
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(const SnackBar(content: Text('Offline: Scan queued for sync')));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Scan Barcode')),
      body: AiBarcodeScanner(
        onScan: _onDetect,
        validator: (value) => value.startsWith('valid_prefix'), // Optional AI validation
        canPop: false,
        bottomBar: const SizedBox(), // Customize UI
      ),
    );
  }
}
```




##### Edge Function for Validation (Deno)
Create a Supabase Edge Function to verify barcodes against order data.

```typescript
// barcode_validate.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.200.0/http/server.ts";
import { supabaseClient } from "./supabase.ts";

serve(async (req) => {
  const { barcode, order_id } = await req.json();
  const { data: order } = await supabaseClient.from('orders').select('skus').eq('id', order_id).single();
  if (order && order.skus.includes(barcode)) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ valid: true }), { status: 200 });
  }
  return new Response('Invalid barcode', { status: 403 });
});
```

This integration enhances inventory management, tying barcode data to Supabase for seamless updates and analytics. For further customization, like multi-barcode batch scanning, extend with package options.
