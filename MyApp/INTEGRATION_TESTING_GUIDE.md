# üß™ Mobile App Integration Testing Guide

## Quick Test Script - 15 Minutes

### Test 1: Mobile Login ‚úÖ (5 minutes)

**Prerequisites:**

- Dashboard is accessible
- You have a user account that works in dashboard

**Steps:**

1. Open mobile app (or web preview)
2. Try to login with dashboard credentials
3. **Expected:** Should login successfully
4. **If fails:** Check error message - likely same tenant_id issue

**Command to start app:**

```bash
cd /workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp
npm start
# Then press 'w' for web, or scan QR for mobile
```

**Verification Queries:**

```sql
-- Check if mobile user has tenant_id
SELECT
    u.email,
    u.tenant_id,
    u.role,
    t.name as tenant_name
FROM public.users u
LEFT JOIN public.tenants t ON t.id = u.tenant_id
WHERE u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HERE';

-- If tenant_id is NULL, mobile login will fail
-- Fix: Run FIX_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql from dashboard fixes
```

---

### Test 2: Order Dashboard ‚Üí Mobile Sync ‚úÖ (5 minutes)

**Prerequisites:**

- Mobile app logged in
- Dashboard accessible
- Driver account (not admin)

**Steps:**

**In Dashboard:**

1. Open Orders page
2. Create new order or select existing
3. Assign to your driver account
4. Note the order number

**In Mobile App:**

1. Go to "My Orders" tab
2. Pull to refresh
3. **Expected:** Assigned order appears in list
4. Tap on order
5. **Expected:** Order details load correctly

**If Order Doesn't Appear:**
Check these queries:

```sql
-- Verify order is assigned to correct driver
SELECT
    id,
    order_number,
    status,
    assigned_driver_id,
    tenant_id
FROM orders
WHERE assigned_driver_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';

-- Check driver's tenant matches order tenant
SELECT
    u.id as user_id,
    u.email,
    u.tenant_id as user_tenant,
    COUNT(o.id) as assigned_orders
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON o.assigned_driver_id = u.id AND o.tenant_id = u.tenant_id
WHERE u.id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.tenant_id;
```

**Realtime Subscription Test:**

```javascript
// Check if subscription is working
// In mobile app console (F12 if on web):
// You should see: "‚úÖ Subscribed to order updates"

// Trigger: Update order status in dashboard
// Expected: Mobile app shows updated status within 10 seconds
```

### Test 3: Location Tracking ‚úÖ (5 minutes)

**Prerequisites:**

- Mobile app logged in
- Order assigned to driver
- Location permissions granted

**Steps:**

**In Mobile App:**

1. Open assigned order
2. Tap "Start Tracking" button
3. **Expected:** Success message "Location tracking started"
4. See tracking icon/indicator showing active
5. (If on real device) Move around
6. (If on simulator) Use Location > Custom Location

**In Dashboard:**

1. Open "Tracking" or "Live Map" view
2. **Expected:** Driver marker appears on map
3. **Expected:** Location updates as driver moves
4. Check timestamp is recent (< 1 minute old)

**Verification Queries:**

```sql
-- Check if locations are being recorded
SELECT
    driver_id,
    recorded_at,
    ST_AsText(location) as location_text,
    accuracy,
    speed
FROM driver_locations
WHERE driver_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY recorded_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Expected output:
-- location_text: "POINT(-122.4194 37.7749)"
-- recorded_at: Recent timestamp
-- accuracy: Number (meters)

-- If no records, check:
SELECT
    d.id,
    d.full_name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(dl.id) as location_count
FROM drivers d
JOIN users u ON u.id = d.id
LEFT JOIN driver_locations dl ON dl.driver_id = d.id
WHERE d.id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
GROUP BY d.id, d.full_name, u.email;
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **No locations recorded:**
   - Check location permissions granted
   - Check LocationService initialization
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Locations not showing in dashboard:**
   - Check PostGIS format is correct
   - Verify map component is rendering
   - Check tenant_id filtering isn't blocking

3. **Old timestamps:**
   - Check background location is enabled
   - Verify tracking service is running
   - Check battery optimization isn't killing app

## Quick Diagnostics

### If Mobile Login Fails

```sql
-- Check user account
SELECT
    au.id,
    au.email,
    au.email_confirmed_at,
    u.tenant_id,
    u.role,
    t.name as tenant_name
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.users u ON u.id = au.id
LEFT JOIN public.tenants t ON t.id = u.tenant_id
WHERE au.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';

-- Fix if needed:
-- 1. Email not confirmed: Confirm in Supabase Dashboard
-- 2. tenant_id NULL: Run FIX_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql
-- 3. No public.users entry: Run FIX_LOGIN_ISSUE.sql Step 2
```

### If Orders Don't Show

```sql
-- Check assigned orders
SELECT
    o.id,
    o.order_number,
    o.status,
    o.assigned_driver_id,
    o.tenant_id,
    u.email as driver_email,
    u.tenant_id as driver_tenant
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = o.assigned_driver_id
WHERE o.assigned_driver_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
OR u.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'orders';
```

### If Location Not Recording

```javascript
// Check in mobile app console (F12 if web):
// Look for these logs:
console.log("‚úÖ Location tracking started");
console.log("üìç Location updated:", lat, lng);
console.log("üíæ Location saved to database");

// If not seeing logs, check:
// 1. LocationService initialization
// 2. Permissions granted
// 3. Network connectivity
```

```sql
-- Check if service is writing to DB
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as location_count,
    MAX(recorded_at) as last_recorded
FROM driver_locations
WHERE driver_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
AND recorded_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Should see:
-- location_count > 0
-- last_recorded within last few minutes
```
