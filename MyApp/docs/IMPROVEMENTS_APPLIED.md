## Technical Details

### Touch Target Standards Applied

Following iOS and Android Human Interface Guidelines:

```javascript
// Minimum touch targets
const MINIMUM_TOUCH_TARGET = 44; // iOS minimum
const RECOMMENDED_TOUCH_TARGET = 52; // Android recommendation
const ENHANCED_TOUCH_TARGET = 56; // For primary actions

// Applied throughout:
button: {
  minHeight: 52, // Ensures minimum
  paddingVertical: 16-18, // Comfortable padding
  paddingHorizontal: 20-24, // Adequate width
}
```

### Visual Improvements

```javascript
// Softer, more modern shadows
shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 4 },
shadowOpacity: 0.10, // Down from 0.12
shadowRadius: 12, // Up from 8
elevation: 4-6, // Appropriate for card hierarchy
```

### Spacing System

```javascript
// Consistent spacing scale
padding: {
  card: 24, // Up from 20 for comfort
  button: 16-18, // Adequate for touch
  section: 16, // Consistent sections
}

marginBottom: {
  card: 16, // Good separation
  infoItem: 20, // Better breathing
}
```
