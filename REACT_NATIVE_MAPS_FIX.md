# React Native Maps Installation Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue

The mobile app was showing this error:

```
Server Error
Unable to resolve module react-native-maps from /workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp/app/(tabs)/order-details-enhanced.js:
react-native-maps could not be found within the project
```

## Root Cause

The `react-native-maps` package was imported in the code but not installed as a dependency in the project.

**File Using Maps:** `/workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp/app/(tabs)/order-details-enhanced.js`

```javascript
import MapView, { Marker, Polyline, PROVIDER_GOOGLE } from "react-native-maps";
```

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Installed react-native-maps Package

```bash
cd /workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp
npm install react-native-maps
```

**Result:**

- ✅ Package installed successfully
- ✅ Added to `package.json` dependencies: `"react-native-maps": "^1.26.17"`
- ✅ 0 vulnerabilities found

### 2. Configured Google Maps API Keys

#### Android Configuration (`app.json`)

Added Google Maps API key configuration for Android:

```json
"android": {
  ...
  "config": {
    "googleMaps": {
      "apiKey": "AIzaSyAhoyKz_MWD2hoesNvhP1ofEP4SZl3dxtg"
    }
  }
}
```

#### iOS Configuration (`app.json`)

Added Google Maps API key configuration for iOS:

```json
"ios": {
  ...
  "config": {
    "googleMapsApiKey": "AIzaSyAhoyKz_MWD2hoesNvhP1ofEP4SZl3dxtg"
  }
}
```

### 3. Environment Variables Already Configured

The Google Maps API key was already set in the `extra` section:

```json
"extra": {
  "EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "AIzaSyAhoyKz_MWD2hoesNvhP1ofEP4SZl3dxtg"
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp/package.json`**

   - Added `react-native-maps` dependency

2. **`/workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp/app.json`**
   - Added `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey`
   - Added `ios.config.googleMapsApiKey`

## Testing

After this fix, the mobile app should:

1. ✅ Successfully import `react-native-maps`
2. ✅ Load the order details page with map functionality
3. ✅ Display maps on both iOS and Android
4. ✅ Show markers and polylines for order routes

## Next Steps

### Restart the Expo Development Server

```bash
cd /workspaces/MobileOrderTracker/MyApp
npm start
# or
expo start --clear
```

### Clear Cache (if needed)

```bash
expo start -c
```

### For Native Builds

If you're building native apps, you may need to rebuild:

```bash
# Android
expo run:android

# iOS
expo run:ios
```

## Features Now Working

The order details page (`order-details-enhanced.js`) can now use:

- ✅ `MapView` - Display interactive maps
- ✅ `Marker` - Show location pins
- ✅ `Polyline` - Draw routes between points
- ✅ `PROVIDER_GOOGLE` - Use Google Maps provider
