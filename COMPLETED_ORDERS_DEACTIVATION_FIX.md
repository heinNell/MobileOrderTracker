# Mobile App - Completed Orders Deactivation Fix

## Problem

When a driver completed an order in the mobile app:

- ✅ Order was marked as "completed" in database
- ✅ Driver was navigated back to orders list
- ❌ **BUT the completed order still appeared in the driver's orders list!**
- ❌ Driver could still access and interact with completed orders

## Root Cause

The queries in the mobile app were fetching **ALL orders** assigned to the driver without filtering out completed or cancelled ones.

### Files with the issue:

1. `orders.js` - "My Orders" tab query
2. `DriverDashboard.js` - "Scanned Orders" section query

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed `/MyApp/app/(tabs)/orders.js`

**Line 194-199:** Updated query to exclude completed and cancelled orders

```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("orders")
  .select("*")
  .eq("assigned_driver_id", user.id)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });

// AFTER (FIXED):
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("orders")
  .select("*")
  .eq("assigned_driver_id", user.id)
  .not("status", "in", '("completed","cancelled")') // ✅ Exclude completed and cancelled
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });
```

### 2. Fixed `/MyApp/app/(tabs)/DriverDashboard.js`

**Line 190-199:** Updated "scanned orders" query to exclude completed, cancelled, and pending

```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const { data: scannedData, error: scannedError } = await supabase
  .from("orders")
  .select("*")
  .eq("assigned_driver_id", user.id)
  .not("status", "eq", "pending") // Only excluded pending
  .order("updated_at", { ascending: false })
  .limit(5);

// AFTER (FIXED):
const { data: scannedData, error: scannedError } = await supabase
  .from("orders")
  .select("*")
  .eq("assigned_driver_id", user.id)
  .not("status", "in", '("pending","completed","cancelled")') // ✅ Exclude all inactive statuses
  .order("updated_at", { ascending: false })
  .limit(5);
```

## How It Works Now

### Complete Order Flow:

1. **Driver clicks "Complete Delivery"**

   - Order status → `completed`
   - `actual_end_time` and `delivered_at` timestamps set
   - Location tracking stopped
   - Success alert shown

2. **App navigates back to orders list**

   - `router.replace('/(tabs)')` executed
   - Driver returns to main screen

3. **Orders query runs**

   - Fetches only active orders: `assigned`, `activated`, `in_progress`, `in_transit`, `loading`, `loaded`, `unloading`
   - **Excludes:** `completed` and `cancelled`

4. **✅ Result: Completed order disappears!**
   - Driver no longer sees the order
   - Can't accidentally interact with it
   - Clean, current orders list

## Order Statuses Visible to Driver

### "My Orders" Tab (orders.js):

Shows orders with statuses:

- ✅ `assigned` - Newly assigned orders
- ✅ `activated` - Order activated by driver
- ✅ `in_progress` - Order started
- ✅ `in_transit` - Driver on the way
- ✅ `loading` - Loading cargo
- ✅ `loaded` - Cargo loaded
- ✅ `unloading` - Unloading cargo
- ✅ `arrived` - Driver arrived at destination

Does NOT show:

- ❌ `completed` - Finished deliveries
- ❌ `cancelled` - Cancelled orders
- ❌ `pending` - Not yet assigned (shouldn't see anyway)

### "Dashboard" Tab (DriverDashboard.js):

**Active Order Section:**

- Shows single active order (any status)

**Scanned Orders Section:**
Shows orders with statuses:

- ✅ `assigned`, `activated`, `in_progress`, `in_transit`, `loading`, `loaded`, `unloading`, `arrived`

Does NOT show:

- ❌ `pending` - Not yet assigned
- ❌ `completed` - Finished deliveries
- ❌ `cancelled` - Cancelled orders

## Testing Checklist

1. **Complete an order:**

   - [ ] Open mobile app
   - [ ] Navigate to an active order
   - [ ] Progress through statuses until "unloading"
   - [ ] Click "Complete Delivery"
   - [ ] Verify success alert appears

2. **Check orders list:**

   - [ ] Verify app navigates back automatically
   - [ ] Check "My Orders" tab - completed order should NOT appear ✅
   - [ ] Check "Dashboard" tab - completed order should NOT appear ✅
   - [ ] Only active orders should be visible

3. **Reload app:**

   - [ ] Press 'R' in Expo terminal to reload
   - [ ] Verify completed order still doesn't appear
   - [ ] Verify active orders still show correctly

4. **Dashboard verification:**
   - [ ] Go to dashboard orders page
   - [ ] Verify completed order shows with "COMPLETED" badge ✅
   - [ ] Verify "Track" and "View" buttons work ✅
   - [ ] Click "View" to see tracking history

## Benefits

✅ **Clean driver interface** - Only shows actionable orders
✅ **Prevents confusion** - Can't accidentally reopen completed orders
✅ **Better UX** - Driver focuses on active deliveries only
✅ **Performance** - Smaller query results, faster loading
✅ **Clear separation** - Active vs historical orders

## Database Stays Intact

**Important:** Completed orders are NOT deleted!

- ✅ Still in database with `completed` status
- ✅ Still visible in admin dashboard
- ✅ Historical tracking data preserved
- ✅ Can generate reports on completed orders
- ✅ Just hidden from driver's active list

## Admin Dashboard Behavior

**No changes to admin side:**

- ✅ Admins can still see ALL orders (including completed)
- ✅ Can filter by status
- ✅ Can access tracking history for completed orders
- ✅ Can export PDFs of completed orders

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `/MyApp/app/(tabs)/orders.js` (line 197)
2. ✅ `/MyApp/app/(tabs)/DriverDashboard.js` (line 193)

## To Apply Changes

Reload the Expo app:

```bash
# In the terminal where Expo is running, press 'R'
# Or in the mobile app, shake device and select "Reload"
```
