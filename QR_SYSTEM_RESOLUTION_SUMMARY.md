# QR Code System Issues - Resolution Summary

## 🚨 Critical Issues Resolved

The QR code system for the Mobile Order Tracker was experiencing several critical issues that have now been **completely resolved**. Here's a comprehensive summary of what was fixed:

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **MIME Type Mismatches** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Browser refused to apply styles and execute scripts due to incorrect MIME types

- CSS files returned `text/html` instead of `text/css`
- JavaScript files returned `text/html` instead of `application/javascript`
- Strict MIME type checking blocked resource loading

**Solution**: Enhanced Next.js configuration

```javascript
// next.config.js - Added proper headers
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/_next/static/css/(.*).css',
      headers: [{ key: 'Content-Type', value: 'text/css' }],
    },
    {
      source: '/_next/static/js/(.*).js',
      headers: [{ key: 'Content-Type', value: 'application/javascript' }],
    },
  ];
}
```

### 2. **Missing Resources (404 Errors)** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Multiple JavaScript files failed to load

- `layout.js`, `app-pages-internals.js`, `main-app.js` returned 404 errors
- Missing favicon caused additional 404 errors

**Solution**: Fixed build configuration and added missing files

- Corrected Next.js App Router configuration
- Added proper favicon files (`favicon.ico`, `favicon.svg`)
- Enhanced metadata configuration in `layout.tsx`

### 3. **Script Execution Blocked** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: JavaScript files blocked from execution due to MIME type mismatches

- Scripts served with `text/html` MIME type couldn't execute
- Strict MIME checking prevented runtime functionality

**Solution**: Fixed server configuration for proper content types

- Updated headers to serve JavaScript with correct MIME types
- Ensured all static assets have proper content-type headers

### 4. **Build Configuration Issues** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Next.js build was looking for `_document.tsx` (Pages Router) while using App Router

- Build failed with "PageNotFoundError: Cannot find module for page: /\_document"
- Inconsistent configuration between router types

**Solution**: Properly configured for Next.js App Router

- Removed references to Pages Router architecture
- Enhanced `app/layout.tsx` with proper TypeScript types
- Added standalone output configuration for production

### 5. **Resource Caching and Performance** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: No proper caching headers for static assets

- Poor performance due to lack of caching
- Resources re-downloaded unnecessarily

**Solution**: Added comprehensive caching strategy

```javascript
{
  source: '/_next/static/(.*)',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Cache-Control',
      value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
    },
  ],
}
```
