# üöÄ COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Fix Missing Drivers Issue

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Your 13 drivers exist in the `drivers` table but don't appear in the dashboard or are unavailable for order assignment.

**Root Cause**: The `sync_user_from_auth()` database trigger overwrites `tenant_id` with NULL in the `users` table, causing drivers to become invisible due to tenant isolation.

**Solution**: Execute the fix script to correct the trigger and restore all NULL `tenant_id` values.

**Impact**:

- ‚úÖ All 13 drivers will become visible immediately
- ‚úÖ New drivers won't disappear after creation
- ‚úÖ Drivers remain visible after order assignment
- ‚úÖ Mobile app can authenticate and sync properly
- ‚úÖ Real-time tracking works correctly

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] You have admin access to Supabase dashboard
- [ ] You can access SQL Editor in Supabase
- [ ] You have backed up your database (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Dashboard is currently showing fewer than 13 drivers
- [ ] You have confirmed tenant_id is `17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43`

---

## üîß Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Execute Diagnostic Query (Optional)

This helps you see the current state before fixing.

```sql
-- Copy and paste from diagnose-missing-drivers.sql
-- Or run this quick check:

SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_drivers_in_drivers_table
FROM drivers
WHERE tenant_id = '17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43';

SELECT
    COUNT(*) as visible_drivers_in_users_table
FROM users
WHERE role = 'driver'
  AND tenant_id = '17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43';

-- If first number is 13 and second is less than 13, you have the bug!
```

### Step 3: Execute Main Fix Script

Copy the entire contents of `FIX_ALL_MISSING_DRIVERS.sql` and paste into SQL Editor.

Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac).

### Step 4: Verify Fix Was Successful

The script will output results at the end. You should see:

```
‚úÖ FIXED DRIVERS
Count: 13
Expected: (Should be 13)

‚ùå STILL BROKEN
Count: 0
Expected: (Should be 0)

üéâ FIX COMPLETE!
visible_drivers: 13
broken_drivers: 0
Status: ‚úÖ All drivers are now visible in dashboard
```

### Step 5: Verify in Dashboard

1. Open your dashboard application
2. Navigate to **Drivers** page
3. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
4. **You should now see all 13 drivers!**

---

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (5 minutes)

- [ ] Dashboard shows all 13 drivers in drivers list
- [ ] Driver names match the inserted data (John, Heinrich Nel, Johan, etc.)
- [ ] All drivers show correct tenant_id in database
- [ ] Create new test driver - appears immediately in list
- [ ] Assign driver to order - driver remains visible (doesn't disappear)

### Mobile App Checks (15 minutes)

- [ ] Driver can log in to mobile app
- [ ] Driver sees their assigned orders
- [ ] Driver can update order status
- [ ] Dashboard receives status updates in real-time
- [ ] Location tracking works (if implemented)

### Database Integrity Checks

Run this query to ensure everything is correct:

```sql
-- Should return 0 rows (no broken drivers)
SELECT * FROM broken_driver_accounts;

-- Should return 13 rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE role = 'driver'
  AND tenant_id = '17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43';

-- Should show all driver names
SELECT full_name, email, tenant_id
FROM users
WHERE role = 'driver'
  AND tenant_id = '17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43'
ORDER BY full_name;
```

## üéØ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create New Driver

1. Dashboard ‚Üí Drivers ‚Üí Click "Create Driver"
2. Fill in details (name, email, phone)
3. Click "Create"
4. **Expected**: Driver appears in list immediately
5. **Expected**: Driver has valid tenant_id (not NULL)

### Scenario 2: Assign Driver to Order

1. Dashboard ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Create new order or select existing
2. Click "Assign Driver"
3. Select one of the 13 drivers
4. Click "Assign"
5. **Expected**: Order shows assigned driver
6. **Expected**: Driver still visible in Drivers page (doesn't disappear!)
7. **Expected**: Driver can see order in mobile app

### Scenario 3: Driver Status Updates

1. Mobile App ‚Üí Login as driver
2. Select assigned order
3. Update status to "In Transit"
4. **Expected**: Dashboard shows status change immediately
5. **Expected**: No errors in console
6. **Expected**: Timeline shows new status

### Scenario 4: Multi-Tenant Isolation

1. Create second admin user in different tenant (if possible)
2. Login as second admin
3. **Expected**: Cannot see drivers from first tenant
4. **Expected**: Cannot see orders from first tenant

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Script Execution Failed

**Error**: `permission denied for table users`

**Solution**: Ensure you're running the script as a database admin or service role.

```sql
-- Check your role
SELECT current_user, session_user;

-- You should be postgres or a superuser
```

**Error**: `trigger "sync_user_trigger" does not exist`

**Solution**: This is fine! The trigger may have been removed already. Continue with the script.

### Issue 2: Still Showing 0 Drivers After Fix

**Possible Causes**:

1. Wrong tenant_id used in queries
2. RLS policies blocking access
3. Dashboard cache not refreshed

**Solutions**:

```sql
-- Check which tenant_id your admin user has
SELECT id, email, tenant_id FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Check if drivers exist with different tenant_id
SELECT DISTINCT tenant_id, COUNT(*)
FROM drivers
GROUP BY tenant_id;

-- If they have different tenant_id, update the fix script
-- Replace '17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43' with correct tenant_id
```

### Issue 3: Drivers Disappear Again After Creating New One

**Cause**: The trigger is still active and broken.

**Solution**:

```sql
-- Check if trigger still exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%sync_user%';

-- Force drop all sync triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS sync_user_trigger ON users;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS sync_user_trigger_on_update ON users;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS sync_user_trigger_on_insert ON users;

-- Re-run the fix script
```

### Issue 4: Mobile App Can't Fetch Orders

**Cause**: RLS policies or tenant_id mismatch

**Solution**:

```sql
-- Check driver's tenant_id
SELECT id, email, tenant_id FROM users WHERE role = 'driver';

-- Check if orders have same tenant_id
SELECT id, order_number, tenant_id, assigned_driver_id
FROM orders
WHERE assigned_driver_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'driver'
);

-- If tenant_ids don't match, update orders
UPDATE orders
SET tenant_id = (
    SELECT tenant_id FROM users WHERE id = orders.assigned_driver_id
)
WHERE assigned_driver_id IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## üîç Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily Checks

Run this query daily to catch issues early:

```sql
-- Should always return 0 rows
SELECT * FROM broken_driver_accounts;
```

If it returns rows, investigate immediately!

### Weekly Checks

```sql
-- Check for orphaned driver records
SELECT
    d.id,
    d.full_name,
    'Drivers without users entry' as issue
FROM drivers d
LEFT JOIN users u ON d.id = u.id
WHERE u.id IS NULL;

-- Check for users without drivers entry
SELECT
    u.id,
    u.full_name,
    'Users without drivers entry' as issue
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN drivers d ON d.id = u.id
WHERE u.role = 'driver' AND d.id IS NULL;
```

### Automated Monitoring (Optional)

Set up a Supabase Edge Function to check daily:

```typescript
// Supabase Function: check-driver-integrity
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabase = createClient(
  Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL")!,
  Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY")!
);

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("broken_driver_accounts")
  .select("*");

if (data && data.length > 0) {
  // Send alert email or notification
  console.error(`‚ö†Ô∏è ${data.length} broken driver accounts detected!`);
  // TODO: Send alert to admin
}
```
