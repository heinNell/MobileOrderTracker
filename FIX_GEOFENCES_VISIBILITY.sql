-- Fix geofences visibility issue
-- The geofences are in the database but not visible due to RLS policies

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 1: CHECK CURRENT GEOFENCES DATA
-- ============================================================================

-- Check enhanced_geofences table
SELECT

  COUNT(*) as total_geofences,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE tenant_id = '17ed751d-9c45-4cbb-9ccc-50607c151d43') as for_your_tenant,

ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 2: CHECK RLS POLICIES ON ENHANCED_GEOFENCES
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 3: FIX RLS POLICIES FOR ENHANCED_GEOFENCES
-- ============================================================================

-- Disable RLS temporarily

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 4: VERIFY GEOFENCES ARE NOW VISIBLE
-- ============================================================================

-- Test visibility
SELECT

-- ============================================================================
-- STEP 5: ALSO FIX REGULAR GEOFENCES TABLE IF IT EXISTS
-- ============================================================================

-- Check if regular geofences table exists and has data
SELECT 
  'üîç Regular Geofences table' as info,
  COUNT(*) as total_geofences
