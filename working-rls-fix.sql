-- üöÄ CLEAN RLS FIX: Working SQL for driver_locations table
-- Based on table structure analysis and requirements

-- First, drop all existing policies to start clean

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_authenticated_select" ON driver_locations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_authenticated_insert" ON driver_locations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_authenticated_update" ON driver_locations;

-- Create permissive policies for authenticated users
