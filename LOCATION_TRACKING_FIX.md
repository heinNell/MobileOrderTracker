# Mobile App Location Tracking Integration Fix

## Issue Summary

The mobile app was unable to sync location updates with the dashboard because the `driver_locations` table was missing from the database. This caused the following problems:

1. ❌ Location updates from mobile app were failing silently
2. ❌ Dashboard couldn't display real-time driver locations
3. ❌ Order tracking showed "No recent location updates"
4. ❌ Integration between mobile app and dashboard was broken

## Root Cause Analysis

The mobile app's `LocationService.js` was trying to insert location data into a `driver_locations` table that didn't exist in the database schema. The app was calling:

```javascript
await supabase.from("driver_locations").insert(locationData);
```

But the table was never created, causing all location tracking to fail.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Database Table

**File:** `create-driver-locations-simple.sql`

- ✅ Created `driver_locations` table with proper schema
- ✅ Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant access
- ✅ Created performance indexes for driver_id, order_id, timestamp
- ✅ Added trigger to update user's last location timestamp
- ✅ Avoided PostGIS dependency issues by using simple lat/lng columns

### 2. Updated Mobile App Code

**File:** `MyApp/app/services/LocationService.js`

- ✅ Removed PostGIS `location` field from insert operations
- ✅ Simplified to use only `latitude` and `longitude` columns
- ✅ Fixed import to remove unused `toPostGISPoint` function
- ✅ Maintained all existing location tracking functionality

### 3. Database Schema Design

The new `driver_locations` table includes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.driver_locations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  driver_id UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  order_id UUID REFERENCES public.orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  latitude NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  longitude NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  accuracy NUMERIC, -- GPS accuracy in meters
  speed NUMERIC, -- Speed in m/s
  heading NUMERIC, -- Direction in degrees (0-360)
  is_manual_update BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  notes TEXT
);
```

### 4. Security & Access Control

**RLS Policies implemented:**

1. **Drivers can insert own location updates** - Ensures drivers can only submit their own locations
2. **Drivers can read own location updates** - Allows drivers to see their tracking history
3. **Admins can read tenant location updates** - Allows managers to monitor their drivers
4. **Users can read tenant driver locations** - Enables dashboard visibility within tenant boundaries

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the automated deployment script
./deploy-location-fix.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Database Setup

1. Connect to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `create-driver-locations-simple.sql`
4. Run the contents of `test-driver-locations.sql` to verify

### Option 3: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# Create the table
supabase db push --file create-driver-locations-simple.sql

# Test the table
supabase db push --file test-driver-locations.sql
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Mobile App Testing

1. Open the mobile app and login as a driver
2. Navigate to an assigned order
3. Tap "Start Tracking" button
4. Move around to generate location updates
5. Use "Send Location Update" if available

### 2. Dashboard Verification

1. Open the dashboard and go to the order details page
2. Check the "Location Updates" section
3. Verify that location updates are appearing in real-time
4. Confirm timestamps and accuracy data are showing

### 3. Database Verification

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check recent location updates
SELECT
  dl.id,
  u.full_name as driver_name,
  dl.latitude,
  dl.longitude,
  dl.timestamp,
  dl.created_at
FROM public.driver_locations dl
JOIN public.users u ON dl.driver_id = u.id
ORDER BY dl.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Technical Details

### Real-time Updates

The dashboard already has real-time subscriptions set up for the `driver_locations` table:

```javascript
// Dashboard subscription (already implemented)
const locationChannel = supabase
  .channel(`driver_locations:${orderId}`)
  .on(
    "postgres_changes",
    {
      event: "INSERT",
      schema: "public",
      table: "driver_locations",
      filter: `order_id=eq.${orderId}`,
    },
    (payload) => {
      setLocationUpdates((prev) => [payload.new, ...prev]);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### Location Data Flow

1. **Mobile App** → `LocationService.startTracking()` → Updates every 30 seconds
2. **Database** → `driver_locations` table → Triggers user update
3. **Real-time** → Supabase subscription → Dashboard updates
4. **Dashboard** → Shows location on order details page

## Expected Results

After implementing this fix:

- ✅ Mobile app location tracking will work seamlessly
- ✅ Dashboard will show real-time driver locations
- ✅ Order tracking will display recent location updates
- ✅ Location history will be stored for analytics
- ✅ Multi-tenant access control will be enforced
- ✅ Performance will be optimized with proper indexes

## Monitoring

Monitor the fix by checking:

1. **Dashboard diagnostics page** - Look for location data
2. **Supabase logs** - Check for insert success/failures
3. **Mobile app logs** - Verify location updates are being sent
4. **Order details page** - Confirm location updates appear

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the table can be safely dropped:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.driver_locations CASCADE;
```

This will restore the system to its previous state without affecting other functionality.
