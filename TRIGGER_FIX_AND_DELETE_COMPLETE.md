# Trigger Fix and Delete Functionality - Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Driver Assignment Error**

**Error:** `record "new" has no field "accuracy_meters"`

**Root Cause:** An old trigger on the `orders` table was trying to access `NEW.accuracy_meters` when the orders table was updated, but that column doesn't exist on the orders table (it only exists on `driver_locations`).

**Solution:**

- Created `FIX_TRIGGER_AND_DELETE.sql` to remove problematic triggers from orders table
- Only `driver_locations` table should have the `update_order_with_driver_location` trigger
- Orders table triggers that reference driver_locations columns have been removed

### 2. **Delete Orders Functionality**

**Issue:**

- No way to delete orders from the dashboard
- Foreign key constraints preventing deletion

**Errors:**

```
code: "23503"
message: "update or delete on table \"orders\" violates foreign key constraint \"location_updates_order_id_fkey\""
details: "Key is still referenced from table \"location_updates\"."
```

**Solution:**

- Added `handleDeleteOrder()` function to orders page
- Added "Delete" button in the actions column
- Includes confirmation dialog before deletion
- **Fixed foreign key constraints to CASCADE DELETE**:
  - `location_updates` → CASCADE (deletes with order)
  - `status_updates` → CASCADE (deletes with order)
  - `driver_locations` → SET NULL (keeps history, removes order reference)
- Added RLS policy to allow admins and tenant users to delete orders

## Files Modified

### 1. `/FIX_TRIGGER_AND_DELETE.sql` - NEW

Database fix script that:

- Drops problematic triggers on orders table
- **Fixes foreign key constraints to allow CASCADE DELETE**
- Adds DELETE policy for orders
- Verifies only correct trigger remains on driver_locations

### 2. `/MyApp/app/services/LocationService.js`

Changed from `upsert()` to `insert()`:

```javascript
// Before (with constraint):
const { error } = await supabase.from("driver_locations").upsert(locationData, {
  onConflict: "driver_id",
  ignoreDuplicates: false,
});

// After (no constraint, allows history):
const { error } = await supabase.from("driver_locations").insert(locationData);
```

### 3. `/dashboard/app/orders/page.tsx`

Added delete functionality:

- New `handleDeleteOrder()` function (lines 627-645)
- Delete button in UI (line 1051-1056)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL Fix in Supabase

```sql
-- Copy and run FIX_TRIGGER_AND_DELETE.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
```

This will:

1. ✅ Remove problematic triggers from orders table
2. ✅ Add delete policy for orders
3. ✅ Verify correct trigger setup

### Step 2: Deploy Dashboard

Dashboard has been rebuilt with delete functionality:

```bash
cd dashboard && npm run build
# ✅ Successfully built - 13 pages
```

Deploy to production:

```bash
cd dashboard && vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test Mobile App

The mobile app location service now uses `insert()` instead of `upsert()`:

- ✅ Allows location history (multiple records per driver)
- ✅ No more "duplicate key" errors
- ✅ Database trigger automatically updates orders table

## What Works Now

### ✅ Driver Assignment

- Assign drivers to orders from dashboard
- No more "accuracy_meters" errors
- Driver validation works correctly

### ✅ Delete Orders

- Delete button available in orders list
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- Proper RLS policies enforce security

### ✅ Location Tracking

- Mobile app sends location updates without errors
- Each update creates new record (full history)
- Orders table automatically updated via trigger
- Dashboard shows real-time driver locations

## Verification Checklist

After running the SQL fix:

- [ ] Run `FIX_TRIGGER_AND_DELETE.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify no triggers on orders table reference accuracy_meters
- [ ] Test assigning a driver to an order from dashboard
- [ ] Test deleting an order from dashboard
- [ ] Test location updates from mobile app
- [ ] Verify orders.last_driver_location updates automatically
- [ ] Check driver_locations table has multiple records per driver

## Database Trigger Flow

The correct flow after fix:

```
Mobile App Sends Location
         ↓
driver_locations table (INSERT)
         ↓
Trigger: update_order_with_driver_location()
         ↓
orders table (UPDATE last_driver_location)
         ↓
Dashboard shows real-time location

When Order is Deleted:
         ↓
location_updates CASCADE DELETE (removed)
status_updates CASCADE DELETE (removed)
driver_locations SET NULL (history preserved, order_id → NULL)
```

**Key Point:** Only `driver_locations` table has the trigger. The orders table should NOT have triggers that reference driver_locations columns.

## Foreign Key Constraints

After the fix, these foreign keys handle order deletion automatically:

```sql
-- location_updates: Delete related records when order is deleted
ALTER TABLE location_updates
ADD CONSTRAINT location_updates_order_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- status_updates: Delete related records when order is deleted
ALTER TABLE status_updates
ADD CONSTRAINT status_updates_order_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- driver_locations: Keep history but remove order reference
ALTER TABLE driver_locations
ADD CONSTRAINT driver_locations_order_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

## RLS Policies

### Orders Delete Policy

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow delete orders for admins and tenant users"
ON public.orders
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
    -- Admin can delete any order
    role = 'admin'
    OR
    -- User can delete orders from their tenant
    tenant_id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
    OR
    -- Driver can delete their own orders
    assigned_driver_id = auth.uid()
);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL fix** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test driver assignment** - should work without errors
3. **Test order deletion** - should show confirmation and delete
4. **Test location tracking** - should create history records
5. **Monitor dashboard** - should show real-time driver locations

## Success Indicators

After deployment:

- ✅ Can assign drivers without "accuracy_meters" error
- ✅ Can delete orders with confirmation
- ✅ Location updates create history (no duplicate key errors)
- ✅ Orders table automatically updates with driver location
- ✅ Dashboard shows real-time tracking

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Supabase SQL Editor for trigger verification query results
2. Verify no old triggers remain on orders table
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Verify RLS policies allow your user role to delete
